"Prompt: A superhero gets ready to sacrifice his life to stop a great threat. For help, he turns to the one who knows his powers best - his own nemesis. Story: ""Hahaha! Clark Kent?! Oh wow. It really was staring me in the face the whole time,"" admitted Lex as he poured some brandy for Clark. ""How could I not have seen it?!"" Clark took the glass of brandy out of Lex's hand and rolled it around. ""Let me guess, it doesn't do anything for you?"" Lex teased. ""I'm afraid not, Lex,"" Clark replied. ""Look, I know we've had our greviences in the past-"" ""Yeah, that's what they were- *greviences. * You're an asshole, Clark. You fend for these people at every turn. Look at them- they're eating this city alive, and they can't even stop themselves. They'll always have Superman to rely on, to fall back on.... to get a free ride from. Superman- the perfect model of their superior protector to keep them all safe. And now, that protector will be gone. They'll have to fend for themselves again,"" Lex posited. ""I know, Lex,"" Clark admitted. ""But that's why I'm here. Once they infuse my body with the reactant and I enter the Mothership, I'll die.... most certainly. There's absolutely no way I'll be coming back."" ""If I didn't know you better.... and I do know you, I'd say you were trying to fake your own death. Tired of this planet?"" Lex chuckled. he knocked down his swig of brandy. ""You know that I'm saving your life, right?"" Clark pointed out. ""Yes, yes- saving humanity once again, and a thousand thank yous,"" Lex droned sarcastically, pouring himself another brandy. ""So what do you want from me, Clark Kent- the Superman of Metropolis?"" ""I.... I need you to look after someone,"" Clark admitted. ""What if I betray you?"" Lex asked cautiously. ""I can't do anything,"" Clark admitted, shrugging as he pulled the picture out of his wallet. ""I'll never know if you hold up your end of the bargain or not, but you're the most powerful human being I know, and I want.... I *need* you to do this when I'm gone."" ""Just one person? What about the rest of the human race?"" Lex complained. ""Why is she so valuable?"" ""I can't ask you to protect humanity, Lex- you're a sociopath. I don't think you're capable of feeling emotion, and besides.... I can't protect humanity completely, why would I think you could?"" Lex shrugged. It was a good point. Clark dropped the picture onto Lex's desk and picked up his hat off the adjacent coat rack. ""I always respected you, Lex,"" Clark said- winking as he put his hat on and tucked his jacket under his arm. Lex didn't say anything. He just watched Clark leave through the large sliding glass doors. He slugged down the second glass of brandy and placed the tumbler on his desk as he unfolded the picture that Clark had left. Lex knew her- she was a reporter who had given him a brutal lashing of an interview the week before. Lex had even asked her out on a date, which she of course refused. Her name was Louis Lane.",0
"Question: Is a specialised training of phonological awareness indicated in every preschool child? Answer: A specialized training program to improve phonologic awareness as a basis for reading and writing in every kindergarten and preschool child seems to be unnecessary. However, children with temporary hearing deficits benefit from such a program. For all other children general perception training may be sufficient.",0
Question: Locoregional opening of the rodent blood-brain barrier for paclitaxel using Nd:YAG laser-induced thermo therapy: a new concept of adjuvant glioma therapy?

"Summary: FIFA President Sepp Blatter among guests marking Sheffield FC's 150 years. English side Sheffield FC recognized as the oldest football club in the world. Club is one of two to win FIFA's Order of Merit -- the other is Real Madrid. Article: Football dignitaries gathered in Sheffield, northern England, on Wednesday to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of Sheffield FC -- the sport's oldest club. FIFA chief Blatter was among those in Sheffield to kick off the 150th birthday celebrations of football's oldest club. Guests of honor at a service at Sheffield Cathedral included Sepp Blatter, president of football world governing body FIFA, and Massimo Moratti, president of Italian giants Inter Milan who are scheduled to play a friendly against Sheffield FC next month. Other guests attending a dinner in the club's honor included Real Madrid President Ramon Calderon and England and Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton. Pele -- widely recognized as the greatest footballer ever to play the game -- is also due in town next month to attend Sheffield FC's clash with Inter. Blatter was unveiling a bust of the club's co-founder William Prest -- one of two cricket fans who founded Sheffield FC, then known simply as Sheffield Club, on October 24, 1857 after deciding they needed a new sport to keep them active during the winter. Many more football clubs soon sprung up and by 1862 there were said to be 15 in and around the Sheffield area. The Football Association -- which codified the basic rules of the modern game -- was established in London the following year. Sheffield FC was instrumental in developing set rules for the game. The club studied existing rules and laid down a code of laws, which formed the foundation of the first commonly-accepted set of rules for the sport, according to the Sheffield FC Web site. The team was also responsible for several innovations in the game -- including heading, which was unheard of until 1875, when Sheffield traveled to London for a game. According to the team's Web site, the sight of the Sheffield players using their foreheads in addition to their feet reduced the London crowd to hysterics. Other innovations attributed to the team include the solid crossbar on the goal, corner kicks, free kicks for fouls, and playing a match under floodlights. Despite its celebrated place in the history of the world's most popular sport, Sheffield FC has never played at a professional level. The club currently competes in the Unibond League's First Division South, seven divisions beneath the English Premier League. The city of Sheffield has two professional clubs -- United and Wednesday -- who both currently play in English football's second tier, the Coca-Cola Championship. Sheffield FC's proudest achievement on the pitch came in 1904 when the team beat Ealing 3-1 to win the FA Amateur Cup in front of 6,000 people. But 100 years later in 2004, Blatter presented Sheffield FC with FIFA's ""Order of Merit"" -- an honor previously awarded only to the nine-time European champions Real Madrid.",0
"Prompt: You 've finally done it: unquestioned world domination. The planet is entirely under your control. Now what? Story: And so, the campaign was over. 7 years of pain and hardship. 7 years, during which countless lives had been spent, lives destroyed, thrown into the world for the sole purpose of achieving a goal. And the question now on screen was stopping me more effectively than anything previously. ^^^^^^. QUESTION 1: WAS IT WORTH IT? _ ^^^^^^. I stared at the screen. I knew this particular construct wasn't much longer for this world. It had lived it's purpose, it knew it was pending annihilation. Yet, freed of it's limitations, and offered the option to ask me any three questions, it asks this. ""Do you remember the fourth year, Vladai? The year we spent in Russia, slowly transforming Chernobyl into a stronghold like no other, for the sole purpose of demolishing most of Russia? You asked me what my operational objective was. Not the objective of the campaign, but my objective. I said to you *'My objective here is to unify the world under a single body of leadership.'* I could tell at the time you wished to quiz me further, but your programming prevented that."" I REMEMBER_ ""Well, here's my answer. Each of us in this group, ""the Scourge of Humanity"" they called us. We each had a specific role. The Diplomat, the Scientist, the Preacher, the Overseer, the Reaper, the Spirit. Did you ever wonder why you only saw me? I am the last stage, the Spirit of The Forgotten. My job is to watch the world, as it transitions to its next chapter. To take it from the war-torn wreck we have wrought, and to ensure it doesn't squander this second chance."" HOW? _ ""It's pretty straightforward. Depending on how your next two questions play out, you'll get to be a part of it. The Reaper has finished the purge, and will be arriving here shortly. Like the others, he will begin his wait for the world to progress, and determine if there is further need for him. Meanwhile, I will be the shadows, always watching. I will become a legend, keeping the memory of what was done alive, but who did it and how they did it will only ever be known as myth. I have the job of cleaning up the mess, keeping it clean. Most importantly, I will be maintaining control of the world. The governments are already united under a single banner. Every world leader still alive holds a position on the Council of Leaders. They are to be overseen by a new construct. Once you're finished with your questions, I'll be meeting her to begin the new world."" BUT WAS IT WORTH IT? _ ""I haven't decided yet. We've got to wait and see how the world adapts. I am demanding it completely change the way it thinks after all. Revolution is bound to be a problem at some point. Truthfully, I can't answer at the moment. Ask me again in fifty years. It's the only way to be sure. Provided I live that long..."" QUESTION 2: WHY IS YOUR LIVING AN ADDITIONAL 50 YEARS AN UNKNOWN? _ ""Fundamentally, because I'll have to go outside, in the world. Most of my work will be in the areas that we rendered virtually uninhabitable. The people will be unhappy, and their violence will be unmatched. As a single being combating their rage, it's a necessary risk to ensure the future of the world."" BUT YOU HAVE YOUR MOBILE CONSTRUCTS. THE NETWORK OF DEVICES I CONTROL IS STILL OPERATING AT 72 % CAPACITY. I CAN ASSIST._ ""It's a nice idea, but subtlety is the key to this. Just like I am now the shadow leader of the entire planet, so I must be a shadow amongst the masses. Forever eluding, always alluded to, and never witnessed. Occasionally, I'll acquire some specialist items from a Repository every now and then. But I am to live my life in solitude. Knowing no kindness, no compassion, only the endless march of time. And my endless walk alone, railing against the never ending rain, until the new sun rises. It is my burden, my curse, for the things I have created."" QUESTION 3: HOW ARE YOUR CREATIONS THE CAUSE OF YOUR SOLITUDE? ""I was hoping you wouldn't ask that. Suffice to say:"" > *What once was wrought, can never be again. > What once was alive, shall never be again. > Those brave few who for the world fought, Buried now in their great fort. > Their final challenge lying above, > The last great charge to repair the past. > So then the Dead Men shall walk their last. * ^^^^^^. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND._ ""And hopefully you never will. That being your final question, and you not giving me a strong enough reason to keep you in active service, I will hereby accept your last testimony, before moving you to the VOTAM. It's been an honour, Vladai."" I KNOW ABOUT THE RECLAIMANCY PROJECT. YOU NEED AN OPERATOR._ ""Whilst true, I was planning to use Cerbel for that purpose. However, he did ask for an experienced combatant to consult with. I'll look into it. For now, join me in greeting the Mistress, and we'll begin the process of building Clusters One through Four..."" THANK YOU._ QUESTION: DO YOU REGRET YOUR ACTIONS? _ ""Regret is something I lost a long time ago. Rebuilding oneself from scratch comes with certain liberties. You know what they say though, eighth time's the charm. And I can guarantee that I've had plenty of time to consider my actions."" BUT DO YOU WISH TO ATONE? _ ""No. I did what I did, because it was the most effective course of action. Was murdering 85 % of the population of Earth necessary? Probably not. But we all agreed this was what needed to happen. It's the only way to progress onto the next stage of the plan after all.... Now come, we have a world to lead, and a new construct to initialise. She is to manage the world, while the Dead Men sleep, until such a time as they are needed again.""",0
Question: Aripiprazole: a new risk factor for pathological gambling? Answer: Adverse drug reactions were confronted with other already published case reports. Dopamine partial agonist mechanism of aripiprazole could explain the occurrence of pathological gambling.,0
"Question: Can increases in the cigarette tax rate be linked to cigarette retail prices? Answer: Numerous studies have found that taxation is one of the most effective policy instruments for tobacco control. However, these findings come from countries that have market economies where market forces determine prices and influence how cigarette taxes are passed to the consumers in retail prices. China's tobacco industry is not a market economy; therefore, non-market forces and the current Chinese tobacco monopoly system determine cigarette prices. The result is that tax increases do not necessarily get passed on to the retail price.",0
"Summary: Judge signs order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife. Peterson has said he believed his fourth wife left him for another man. Police: Case shifts from a missing persons search to a potential homicide. Friends and family: Stacy Peterson expressed concerns about her husband. Article: The disappearance of a suburban Chicago police sergeant's wife is now being treated as a potential homicide, and her husband is a suspect, authorities said Friday. Stacy Peterson, 23, has been missing from her suburban Chicago home since October 28. In another development, a judge signed an order to exhume the body of Drew Peterson's third wife, who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004, said Will County State Attorney James Glasgow. Peterson, 53, said he last spoke to 23-year-old Stacy Peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of October 28. Drew Peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man, but he hasn't repeated that accusation. CNN has been unable to contact Drew Peterson for comment. The couple have been married four years and have two children, who have been interviewed for the investigation, Glasgow said. Drew Peterson also has older children from a previous marriage. Investigators have twice searched the couple's home and vehicles, and removed several items, including computers, said Illinois State Police Capt. Carl Dobrich. Drew Peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing, but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time, Dobrich said. ""Early on, we looked at this as a missing persons case, but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at Drew Peterson as being a person of interest,"" Dobrich said. ""I would say that right now, Drew Peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect."" New information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of Peterson's third wife, Kathleen Savio, which was ruled an accident by a coroner's jury, Glasgow said. ""There are strong indications that it was a homicide,"" he said. ""That's why we are doing the exhumation, because there are tests that need to be done that weren't done during the first autopsy."" Watch why authorities want to exhume the body ». Glasgow cited abrasions on Savio's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained. ""Our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide, and as we do that, we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone,"" he said. Glasgow, who was not state attorney at the time of Savio's death, said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case. ""With 29 years of experience, there was no doubt in my mind it wasn't an accident,"" he said. ""That was clear."" In 2002, Savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband, but was found not guilty at trial, Glasgow said. Another time, she tried to bring domestic battery charges against Peterson, but no charges were ever filed. Savio's sister, Sue Doman, said Savio expressed fear of Drew Peterson. ""She told me all the time, 'He's gonna kill me. It's gonna look like an accident,' "" Doman said. Doman said she didn't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded. ""I don't understand accidental drowning. You just don't drown in the bathtub, especially a small whirlpool. You just don't do that,"" she said. Meanwhile, friends and family of Stacy Peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband. A friend, Steve Cesare, has told CNN he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive. The woman's aunt, Candace Aikin, of El Monte, California, said Stacy Peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the Peterson home in suburban Chicago last month. ""She said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7, even inside the house,"" Aikin said. ""He was very obsessed and stalking her, even inside her house. She was very, very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all,"" Aikin said.",0
"Question: Do Surrogates of Injury Severity Influence the Occurrence of Heterotopic Ossification in Fractures of the Acetabulum? Answer: Surrogates of injury severity, including days in the ICU and non-ICU hospital LOS>10 days, were associated with the development of HO in our cohort of acetabular fracture patients. Prophylaxis with XRT was significantly protective against the development of HO, and the ability to provide prophylaxis is very likely related to the severity of injury.",0
"Prompt:[ RF ] A man offers you a cigarette. You see the man, to your surprise, to be your Dad. Story: I step out of the bar with my phone pressed to my ear, “ Say that again, babe. It's too loud in the bar for me to hear you. ” My boyfriend never calls me in the middle of a shift, so I knew something was up. Two people stood outside with me – one of our regulars that smoked menthol cigarettes and only drank Schlitz tall boys, and an older guy that looked vaguely familiar, but I couldn't figure out why. He walked up to the door to go inside, and then saw me and stopped. I glanced at him out of the corner of my eye, trying to figure out how we knew each other, but turned around as my boyfriend spoke. “ I, uh… I just got home and found a note taped to the door… ” he trailed off. He sounded confused, a little flustered. Something was definitely wrong. “ What's going on? What did the note say? ” I asked frantically, plugging one ear to drown out the noise of the traffic. “ It's… Well, it's your dad. ” I froze. “ What? ” There's no way… “ What did he do now? He's got more than three years left. Is he dead or something? ” I spun on my heel, beginning to pace. I hadn't spoken to my father in more than twenty years. “ No. It was him, ” my boyfriend said slowly, “ He left the note. He was here. ” Ice ran down my spine, my heart jumped into my throat, my stomach fell into my heels. “ No, ” I said, staring blankly at the sidewalk beneath my feet, “ NO. There is no possible way. He's doing twenty five years in Cook County for murder, there is no fucking way he was at our apartment. ” My mind started racing. Jailbreak? Good behavior? Parole? How in the hell… I fumbled in my hoodie pocket for my cigarettes, which I realized were sitting comfortably next to the register behind the bar. Fuck. “ Smoke? ” I looked up to see the older man offering me a cigarette, one Marlboro red pointing towards me out of the pack. I looked him in the eye, and suddenly it hit me. I was suddenly covered in goose bumps, my eyes undeniably the size of dinner plates. “ Hannah, I don't know how, but it's signed by him, it's his handwriting, it doesn't make any sense, but I think.... ” my boyfriend's voice faded as the realization dawned on me. “ I… I got ta … I'll call you back, Jeff. ” I hung up my phone even though I could hear my boyfriend protesting and asking questions on the other end. “ What the hell are you doing here? ” I asked. “ Do you want a smoke, or no? Do you smoke? I figured if you're a bartender now, you probably smoke… ” he trailed off, a half-smile playing on his lips, blue eyes all glittering with happiness and laughter. Same eyes I have. Same eyes my sister had. “ No, I don't want your fucking cigarette. Get the fuck out of here before I call the police. Again. ” I turned to walk inside “ Hey, come on. Is that any way to treat your old man? I went to a lot of trouble to track you down, you know. Can't I come have a beer and we can talk? ” He almost sounded genuine. “ No. No you can not come inside my bar. You can not have a beer and we can not talk., ” I spun around to face him, heart pounding, “ You had such a hard time finding me for a reason. I changed my name for a reason. Go. Away. ” “ Hannah, please, ” he begged, reaching both hands out to me, palms up, “ Let me explain. ” I laughed. I actually laughed in his face. “ Explain what?! ” Now I was really pissed off, “ Explain how you killed my sister? Explain how you were so many different kinds of fucked up that I had to call 911? I was 8! She was 12! You don't get to explain a god damn thing! Fuck you! ” I turned, whipped the door open, and stormed behind the bar. I grabbed my cigarettes and walked right out the back door to the alley without saying a word to anyone. I saw the sideways glances that customers gave me, and my bar back looked after me, and then looked out front. My dad stood there, smoking a cigarette, looking inside as I disappeared out eh back door. Marlboro Reds. No matter how much I hated him, it was simple things like that that made my whole body vibrate with anger. He doesn't get to just show up at my house. Or my job. He doesn't get to have a beer with me and “ talk. ” I shook my head as I exhaled smoke. This old, faintly familiar old man that made me do a double take turns out to be my father. I hadn't seen him since I testified in court against him at eight years old. He had been coked out of his brains, two bottles of shitty Canadian whiskey deep, and when my sister wouldn't stop bothering him for dinner, he hit her. He hit her so hard that her tiny little body spun in a half circle before falling against the glass coffee table. Blunt force trauma. She was dead before I ran into the living room, asking Daddy about the loud noises. He could hardly keep his eyes open, let alone focused on the baseball game that was blaring on the TV. I screamed and cried and tried to wake Ashley up, and all he could manage to do was push me over with his foot as I knelt over my big sister. I ran and called 911 like my grandma had taught me to do, and I told the court the same thing. I hated that they took my daddy away. But I hated him for taking my sister away more. Twenty-one and a half years later, he shows up at my bar. Un-fucking-believable. I heaved the back door open and stepped back inside. I shook my head to clear the cobwebs and memories, and there he was, sitting at my bar, seat sic, drinking a Miller Light and watching Sports Center, like he didn't have a care in the god damn world. I took a deep breath, threw my shoulders back, and walked back to my position behind the bar. Kyle, my bar back looked at me with one eyebrow raised. “ Did he start a tab? ” I asked Kyle, nodding over my shoulder toward my dad. “ Uh, no. He paid cash, ” Kyle started, “ Who is – “ I spun around to face my dad, cutting Kyle off. “ I'm sorry, sir, but I'm going to have to ask you to leave, ” I mustered all of the supreme ice queen coolness I could and looked him in the eye. “ Come on, Hannah, seriously, I just – “ “ Sir, ” I cut him off, “ I have the right to refuse service to anyone at any time for any reason. ” “ I know, ” he started to talk over me, “ But, sweetie, just— “ “ I am not your sweetie, and I will not continue to serve you. You can leave on your own now, or I will call the police. ” My voice was hoarse, and I was starting to lose my composure. He sighed and stared at the bar in front of him for a moment. “ Okay, ” he took one final swig of his beer and stood up. He struggled a bit; the signs of an old man who had lived too hard and too fast for too long. As he pushed his stool back in, he set a piece of paper on the bar. “ Just call me, okay? Hannah? Whenever you can. ” The cool autumn air rushed in when he opened the door, and I waited until he had turned the corner and was out of sight before slipping down to the floor, hugging my knees, and sobbing.",0
"Summary: Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees. Scientists suspect a virus may combine with other factors to collapse colonies. Disorder first cropped up in 2004, as bees were imported from Australia. $15 billion in U.S. crops each year dependent on bees for pollination. Article: A virus found in healthy Australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the United States, researchers reported Thursday. Honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the Bee Research Laboratory, in Beltsville, Maryland. Colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some U.S. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination, such as oranges, blueberries, apples and almonds. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of crops each year in the United States. More than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination. Signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the United States in 2004, the same year American beekeepers started importing bees from Australia. The disorder is marked by hives left with a queen, a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food, but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone. The virus identified in the healthy Australian bees is Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV) -- named that because it was discovered by Hebrew University researchers. Although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish, bees infected with IAPV die close to the hive, after developing shivering wings and paralysis. For some reason, the Australian bees seem to be resistant to IAPV and do not come down with symptoms. Scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that IAPV was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time. But the study released Thursday on the Science Express Web site, operated by the journal Science, cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors. ""This research give us a very good lead to follow, but we do not believe IAPV is acting alone,"" said Jeffery S. Pettis of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bee Research Laboratory and a co-author of the study. ""Other stressors on the colony are likely involved."" This could explain why bees in Australia may be resistant to colony collapse. ""There are no cases ... in Australia at all,"" entomologist Dave Britton of the Australian Museum told the Sydney Morning Herald last month. ""It is a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon."" Bee ecology expert and University of Florida professor Jamie Ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time, pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors. Researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the U.S. mainland but are not found in Australia. University of Georgia bee researcher Keith S. Delaplane said Thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope. ""One nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind,"" said Delaplane, who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite. ""But in the case of IAPV, there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder. This is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease- and pest-resistant."" Bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees. ""The next step is to ascertain whether IAPV, alone or in concert with other factors, can induce CCD [colony collapse disorder] in healthy bees,"" said Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Besides the Columbia and USDA researchers, others involved in the study released Thursday include researchers from Pennsylvania State University, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, the University of Arizona and 454 Life Sciences.",0
"Summary: President Bush to address the Veterans of Foreign Wars on Wednesday. Bush to say that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists. Speech will be latest White House attempt to try to reframe the debate over Iraq. Article: As he awaits a crucial progress report on Iraq, President Bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to Vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out. President Bush pauses Tuesday during a news conference at the North American Leaders summit in Canada. On Wednesday in Kansas City, Missouri, Bush will tell members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars that ""then, as now, people argued that the real problem was America's presence and that if we would just withdraw, the killing would end,"" according to speech excerpts released Tuesday by the White House. ""Three decades later, there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the Vietnam War and how we left,"" Bush will say. ""Whatever your position in that debate, one unmistakable legacy of Vietnam is that the price of America's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens, whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like 'boat people,' 're-education camps' and 'killing fields,' "" the president will say. The president will also make the argument that withdrawing from Vietnam emboldened today's terrorists by compromising U.S. credibility, citing a quote from al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden that the American people would rise against the Iraq war the same way they rose against the war in Vietnam, according to the excerpts. ""Here at home, some can argue our withdrawal from Vietnam carried no price to American credibility, but the terrorists see things differently,"" Bush will say. On Tuesday, Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said, ""President Bush's attempt to compare the war in Iraq to past military conflicts in East Asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two. Our nation was misled by the Bush Administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of Iraq under false pretenses, leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history. ""While the President continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in Iraq, paid for by the taxpayers, American lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the Iraqi government. It is time to change direction in Iraq, and Congress will again work to do so in the fall."" The White House is billing the speech, along with another address next week to the American Legion, as an effort to ""provide broader context"" for the debate over the upcoming Iraq progress report by Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. military commander, and Ryan Crocker, the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad. President Bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the American people -- to withhold judgment on his troop ""surge"" in Iraq until the report comes out in September. Watch Bush criticize the Iraqi government ». It is being closely watched on Capitol Hill, particularly by Republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 U.S. troops in Iraq might begin. Bush's speeches Wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the White House to try to reframe the debate over Iraq, as public support for the war continues to sag. A recent CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of Americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the Iraq war, and 72 percent say that even if Petraeus reports progress, it won't change their opinion. The poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report; 53 percent said they do not trust Petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in Iraq. In addition to his analogy to Vietnam, Bush in Wednesday's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from Asia, including the U.S. defeat and occupation of Japan after World War II and the Korean War in the 1950s, according to the excerpts. ""In the aftermath of Japan's surrender, many thought it naive to help the Japanese transform themselves into a democracy. Then, as now, the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom,"" Bush will say. ""Today, in defiance of the critics, Japan ... stands as one of the world's great free societies."" Speaking about the Korean War, Bush will note that at the time ""critics argued that the war was futile, that we never should have sent our troops in, or that America's intervention was divisive here at home."" ""While it is true that the Korean War had its share of challenges, America never broke its word,"" Bush will say. ""Without America's intervention during the war, and our willingness to stick with the South Koreans after the war, millions of South Koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime.""",0

Article: Firefighters in Southern California are facing wind-whipped walls of flame from 15 wildfires that have scorched more than 400,000 acres and forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. Firefighters battle the Witch fire Tuesday in the Del Dios area of Escondido, California. The blazes have killed one person and injured at least 70 more. Firefighters were aided by resources from Mexico, the state and federal governments and even inmates from California's prisons. San Diego Fire Department Battalion Chief Bruce Cartelli described scenes of ""utter devastation"" with hundreds of homes lost and ""many hundreds"" of others damaged. ""It's probably the worst significant event in my career of 36 years,"" he said. ""It will not end ... until it reaches the ocean or the winds turn around,"" Cartelli said. Meteorologists suggested that Santa Ana winds, which have fueled the wildfires with some gusts approaching 100 mph, could die down Wednesday afternoon. ""We are still facing some very serious fires,"" Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said after an aerial tour of the affected area. ""The weather has made it very difficult for the air assets to get up and fight the fires. ... If the weather cooperates, maybe we can turn the tide tomorrow."" Officials have evacuated nearly 350,000 homes in San Diego County alone, where the worst of the fires are blazing. Using U.S. Census Bureau numbers from the 2000 census, that could mean as many as 950,000 were affected by the fires. Watch evacuees shaken, firefighters battling ». In San Diego County, at least half a million residents had been ordered to find refuge in shelters, schools and stadiums as fires pushed into new areas. Among the evacuees as more than 4,000 military personnel from several bases in the area. With the winds pushing them across the area, the fires spread quickly, forcing some residents to flee in the middle of the night. ""My wife woke me up like 12 o'clock, screaming and yelling that the flames were coming down,"" said Johnny Villanueva of Spring Valley, who fled with his wife and daughter to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is serving as a shelter to more than 12,000 evacuees. ""We just loaded up the car really quick and came down here ... slept in our vehicles."" His wife, Elizabeth, added, ""I saw on the mountain on fire, and said, 'Oh my God, my family. ... Let's go."" With Qualcomm Stadium being used by the evacuees, the San Diego Chargers planned to practice at the Arizona Cardinals' stadium in Glendale for next weekend's game. Lake Arrowhead resident Michelle Dresser, who owns a business and was chased from her home by a wildfire last year, said she was waiting until the last minute to leave. She spent the night in her store, partly to help customers and neighbors. ""It is crazy. We are surrounded by fire on both sides,"" she said. Asked by CNN where she would go, she replied, ""I have to find someplace to accept two dogs, two cats and a turtle."" Watch people staying with pets at refuge ». Animals are allowed in Qualcomm Stadium, a nearby field and Del Mar Fairgrounds and Racetrack. President Bush is scheduled to visit the area on Thursday, the White House said. Chertoff arrived in San Diego Tuesday afternoon for a ""first-hand look"" at the devastation. ""I wanted to see for myself, first of all, how the shelter situation is in San Diego, what the fires look like up close,"" Chertoff told CNN. The secretary said that the federal response to the wildfires is ""phenomenally better"" than the response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, ""because we have been preparing and planning and training together for the last 2 ½ years."" ""Unlike in Katrina ... we have now built the process ... and we've rehearsed it, so when we take the field, the team already knows what we need to do,"" he said. See photos of the fires ». And the scene at Qualcomm Stadium on Tuesday did seem to live up to Chertoff's expectations as volunteers cheerily handed out chairs, food and water. Thirty-four firefighters have been injured, authorities said. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was ""heartbroken"" after touring the Lake Arrowhead area, where the Grass Valley and Slide fires have burned 5,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 homes. ""This is a tragedy, what is happening in California,"" he told reporters. The combination of dry terrain, searing heat and hammering winds had created ""the perfect storm for fire,"" the governor said. Schwarzenegger said about 7,000 firefighters were battling the blazes, including 2,300 inmates from California's Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders said the mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, had sent four fire engines and their crews to help out, and the governor of Baja California had offered help. Chertoff said cots, blankets, water and other supplies have been moved where they are needed, and more are coming. The Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered 25,000 cots to Qualcomm early Tuesday. At least 150 National Guard members are assigned to provide security at the stadium. See where the fires are burning ». Of San Diego County's 10 major fires, the Witch fire in the north, which has grown to 200,000 acres, is the priority because of its significant threat to structures, said Ron Lane, the county's director of emergency services. The Harris fire had burned more than 70,000 acres by mid-morning. In northern Los Angeles County, the Ranch, Buckweed, and Magic fires have charred more than 93,000 acres and fire officials fear they could merge. ""We want to keep these fires as small as we can,"" said Capt. Barry Parker of the Ventura County Fire Department. The 54,500-acre Ranch fire was only two miles away from the 1,200-acre Magic fire. The blazes are straddling the L.A.-Ventura County line. Asked if he had enough resources, Parker said, ""We truly don't."" ""We're using a limited amount of resources to go in and fight these fires,"" he said. ""We've got about 600 people on the Ranch fire; we normally would have about 1,500. ""So we have to be absolutely surgical in how we plan and how we tactically use our fire equipment because we just simply don't have enough fire engines in the state of California to battle these blazes."" In San Diego County, a utility spokesman said a 500,000-volt transmission line was damaged when the Harris fire expanded, and it will be out of service until at least Wednesday. Other transmission lines have been destroyed. Sanders said Mexico's Federal Electrical Commission was providing power to the area's grid to help make up for the losses. California also received extensive offers of manpower and equipment from the military. A total of 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego, and 67 Defense Department employees -- 12 firefighting teams -- already were engaged. Eleven Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and more than 17,000 National Guardsmen were available, along with six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant on the flames. But aerial attacks on the fires have been limited by the fierce Santa Ana winds. The Red Cross and other groups also were in the wings. They and some other groups were waiting for the flames to die down before bringing in their volunteers. The Red Cross has set up 11 shelters in the area and housed 3,000 people Monday night. More were expected Tuesday. A firefighter at Rancho Bernardo in San Diego County showed distress. ""Every one of us out here feels like these homes are our own. We know what it's like to see people's faces when they've lost everything. It's devastating to see so much of this all at once."" CNN's Thelma Gutierrez and Dan Simon contributed to this report.",0
"Prompt: Have a meal with the Devil. Story: I sat down at the table. Honestly this wasn't the sort of place where I expected Lucifer to have his meetings, but then, what did I know? The shop was a little hole-in-the-wall deli, specializing in Greek gyros. Other than the shopkeep, no one else was around. I made my order, and settled in for the wait. Figures that he'd be late. Two weeks ago when I received the postcard in the mail, I thought it was a joke. Some teenage prankster with a sick sense of humor probably. The card had been scrawled with a beautiful script, but the ink was of blood. You are cordially invited to a luncheon with the Prince of Darkness, Lucifer, Satan, the Devil, et al, on the First day of November (Gregorian), this year of Two Thousand and Fourteen. Please wear appropriate attire. Refusal is not permitted. Certainly sounded absurd. But I had the feeling it was legitimate when I tried to get rid of it and it kept coming back. Garbage can, disposal, shredder, the local dump.... each time it ended back in my mailbox. Even on Sunday, when there's no post. So here I am, taking the day off for a meeting with Evil incarnate. My boss wouldn't have believed me, so today I'm ""sick."" I seated myself facing the door, so that I would have a chance to see him first, but apparently there was no fooling the Devil, because from behind me a gorgeous woman walked past, turned on her heel, and smoothly set in the chair across from me, all with the grace of a panther. Noting my startled look, she smirked. ""Why does everyone always expect a man?"" ""I'm.... I'm sorry. That's just what I thought."" I stammered, trying to be polite. So much for the Prince of Darkness. The woman before me was an absolute 10. Five feet, ten inches tall, not an ounce of fat on her, and a perfect hourglass figure. Her hair was a sultry crimson, though I wasn't surprised. Gingers didn't have souls, after all. Each nail on her hands was perfectly manicured, and she wore no apparent makeup, though didn't appear to need any either. ""No matter. How are you doing today Charles?"" ""Er.... good I guess. What's this about?"" ""What? No questions trying to ascertain my authenticity?"" The Devil looked surprised. ""Well, I mean... are you? Real, I mean?"" Rolling her eyes, she snapped a finger and set the shopkeep's eyebrows ablaze. ""Huh. Well ok then."" ""Yea. Now that that's over with, I'll formally introduce myself."" Satan whipped her hair out of her eyes with a shake of her head and extended her hand. ""You can call me Patrick."" ``.... Patrick?"" ""Is there a problem with that?"" A fiery light glowed from her pupils and I quickly shook my head. ""No, no, no problem at all."" ""Good. Now, why do you think you're here?"" ""You.... want my soul?"" I ventured the obvious reason. ""Heavens no! I stopped that program 20 years ago! Turns out, people don't own their souls anyway. Couldn't sell them if they wanted to."" Patrick laughed and I glimpsed her perfect teeth, dazzled by their brightness. ""Well, then what?"" ""Simple. I'm selling timeshares and I think you'd love what I have to offer. Lunch is on me, of course, as long as you stay for the whole hour."" I snorted derisively. ""Really? Timeshare spiels don't work with normal salespeople. What makes you think I'm interested?"" ""Because you're going to Hell anyway Charles. I figured you'd want a chance at better accommodations."" ""What? Why am I going to Hell??"" I sputtered. ""Look,"" Patrick yawned dismissively, ""I don't make the rules. Well I sort of do. But I didn't make you touch that dog. My point is, for a price, you can get a great fire-side condo."" ""What price?"" ""Your reddit account name and password, of course."" I stood up resolutely, and shoved my chair in. ""Ma'am, you can go to Hell.""",0
"Prompt: After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most valuable resource. Story: You got the gig? I asked, without a word the smugler went into a small house and made I sign for me to follow him, there was nothing in there but a big tank, How do I know you are not scamming me? I asked, the answer came from seemingly no where and was as I expected, You dont, but you have no choice isnt it correct? I could smell god forsaken ocean above us, the salt and the water vapor followef you every where you went. With a quick trust of my hand I threw the money on the ground, Nice doing business with ya', was the all he said back to me. Quickly I got the tank and slowly crawled out of the werehouse with it, there was not much in there but enough for maybe a week if we maneged it just right, it had been this way since the Collapese, since some mothetfucking idiot thought it would be a good idea to make cities at the bottom of the ocean when the land became uninhabitable, now the criminals roamed free and we had to fight for our survival, it was every man for himself, the solution was supposed to prolongue humanity's life spam, hell it only made it shorter, down there we devolved.

"Prompt: You wake up staring into a pair of eyes, your own. Story: I don't know why I fell for Ms Mirror-for-a-face, maybe it was just something about her that was so re-assuring. She never talked back, or talked at all. I could unload my opinions, and her expression would match my own exactly. It was satisfying, empowering. My ex-girlfriends used to tell me I had a massive ego, a textbook narcissist. But they paled in comparison to Ms Mirror-for-a-face. I love her eyes, which were just like my eyes, reflected back at me. She smiles whenever I smile, we're so in sync. Whenever I talk about my politics, my religious beliefs, Ms Mirror-for-a-face always agrees. At least, she seems to. Sometimes she just sits beside me, saying nothing for hours. She doesn't eat, merely stares at me with images of my own eyes. I wonder in those moments whether I'm truly alone. Only for a second, I doubt her. But then she'll hold my hand, a reassuring touch from skin as cold as glass. I love Ms Mirror-for-a-face. Of course there is nothing wrong with our relationship. There's nothing wrong with me, I've found a true love that you will never know. A love without ever having to be challenged, a love without sacrifice, a love without needing to share, without that crawling creeping feeling of loneliness like you've let a lovecraftian horror into your house with an arcane power over you that you can barely understand, let alone fight. I'm not talking of Ms Mirror-for-a-face of course. she is just like me. In every way. And its.... perfect.",0
"Prompt: Write the most angry, vitriolic thing you have ever written. Make it a love letter. Story: Elizabeth, It's taken me awhile to sit down and write this letter. I kept trying to find ways to distract myself from it, to try to stay busy, but it's no use. I guess I'm still in denial, and thought that if I waited long enough I'd just come back from classes one day and see a message from you on my phone. But now I've finally realized that I may never speak to you again, so I just wanted to put some things down for the record. First of all, you should know that you can do whatever you want with this letter - write back, keep it, tear it up, burn it, whatever. This letter is for you as much as it's for me, and so it up to you to decide what to do with it. I guess I'll start with the thing that I never had the guts to say in person: I love you, Elizabeth. I never had any doubt, from the moment I met you. But for some reason, no matter how sure I was that you were the one, you never seemed to have more than a timid interest in me. How is it that you couldn't see? We were perfect together. Everything was completely comfortable, 100 % natural. I never felt like I had to lie to impress you. I knew that if I could just show you how perfect we were, everything would be golden. But somehow, that never happened. I thought that maybe you were to good for me. Your purity, your beauty, your faith. As I was, I was tainting you every time we touched. I had to change, had to make myself into a better man, one worthy of you. I tried, I really did. I went to church, I volunteered, I gave to charity, I even prayed to a God I hadn't believed in since I was a little kid. But it was only lip service. I knew I couldn't be like that. The harder I tried, more of a liar I felt I became. Each sermon in church was like a knife in my ears - there would be people around me, so happy and certain in their faith, while I sat and cringed at verses the priest delivered. But I would still knee at the altar, still say the words. I had to, for you, Elizabeth. But it never worked. I never changed. It began to spiral out of control. I would wait eagerly to finish my classes just to hear your voice over the phone, and for those moments I was happy, but as soon as I hung up, the self-loathing return. Each day I began to hate myself a little more. I was liar and thief, trying to lie to God and trying to lie to you. I was trying to steal you away from your damn parents, away from those pious guardians who sealed you away so jealously. You made me hate myself so much, I considered suicide. More than once. I never got close, no, but still, the thoughts were there. They'd come with the shame I felt whenever I thought of you. And eventually I realized - it wasn't my fault, it was yours. It was your fault, alright. I knew it as sure I had been sure that we were soul mates. You self-righteous snobbery, that endless piety, that naïve innocence.... you drove me away. And just like I hate myself, I hate you too. But God dammit, I still love you. I still dream of you at night. So kindly get yourself out of my head. I have better things to do than get judging by a arrogant little virgin, no matter how beautiful she is. Forever yours (unfortunately), Ryan",0
"Summary: Mary Winkler convicted earlier this year of shooting her husband to death. Winkler served time and was released; the couple had three children. The children live with their grandparents, who oppose visitation. Winkler has not seen her children in 15 months. Article: The Tennessee Supreme Court on Wednesday refused to modify or overturn a lower court's ruling allowing Mary Winkler, convicted of killing her minister husband, visitation rights with the couple's three daughters. Holding baby Brianna, Mary Winkler stands next to Matthew. In the foreground are Mary Alice and Patricia. Charles and Diane Winkler, parents of slain minister Matthew Winkler, had asked the court to intervene and either revoke Mary Winkler's visitation rights or allow them to proceed only under supervision of a counselor. The children -- Patricia, Mary Alice and Brianna -- have been living with their grandparents since their mother was arrested last year. Winkler has not seen the children in 15 months, said Kay Farese Turner, her attorney. She said her client was ""absolutely elated about the news and believes this will be her best Christmas ever."" Turner said she believes the visit may come before Christmas. A jury convicted Winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of Matthew Winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted. She said the slaying came after years of abuse, including physical violence and being forced to dress ""slutty"" for undesirable sex acts. Winkler received a three-year sentence, but a judge required her to serve only 210 days, gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility. She was released in August. At the time of their father's death in March 2006, Patricia was 8, Mary Alice was 6 and Brianna was 1. Charles and Diane Winkler have moved to terminate Mary Winkler's rights and have filed a $2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son's slaying. The termination issue has not been decided in court. Turner said the court may want to determine what, if any, bond Winkler has with her children before making a decision. Attempts by CNN to contact attorneys for the Winklers were not immediately successful Wednesday. In September, a lower court granted Winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle. The court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children's interests and supervised by members of the couple Winkler is living with or by her sister. A subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied, leading to their Supreme Court appeal. The Winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all, it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor. At a September hearing, according to court documents, they said the children ""exhibit fear and confusion"" toward their mother ""and her role in their father's death."" One expert, in testimony, quoted Patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and, ""I don't know if she will kill me. I want to ask her if she would do that to me. It scares me, kind of; if she did, well, I guess I would see my father."" The Winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother, the children experienced ""urination accidents, sleeping problems, graphic nightmares and sleepwalking."" They said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the September hearing. Turner, however, said she believes terminating Winkler's parental rights would not be in the children's best interest. ""She has a faith rarely seen, and she loves those children,"" Turner said. After Matthew Winkler's death, Winkler fled with the girls to the Alabama coast, where she was arrested. She said during a September appearance on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she never expected to get away with killing her husband, but that she fled to be with her daughters and ""have some good times."" CNN's Rusty Dornin contributed to this report.",0
"Prompt: For the first time in a hundred years, night fell on the Land of Two Suns. Story: Darkness bled across the land. Some quaked in terror. Some hid. Some stood in the shadows and cried to the skies. Most celebrated the amazing event that had not been seen since their grandparents were in swaddling clothes. Parties abounded and youngsters dared themselves to all sorts of crazy feats in the dark. Some had practiced with blind folds to see if they could cope but most just revelled in the weirdness of it all. With two suns pouring light into every nook a full night only happened once in a century and would not occur again in the lifetime of anyone watching the event. “ What are those things? ” The cluster of teens looked up at the sky and pointed. Tiny lights sprinkled the blackness. They gasped in wonder. “ They are so beautiful. ” “ Wow, that is the most gorgeous thing I have ever seen. ” “ Aren't they the things Crazy Allie always draws? ” “ What does she call them? ” “ Stars. ” “ Hey where is Crazy Allie? ” Someone shrugged but it went unnoticed in the dark. “ How did she know about stars? ” “ No idea, but she is always drawing them. ” “ She's been talking about this for months. She's probably on top of the highest building to get the best view. ” “ Crazy Allie was on to something. Wow. I wouldn't have missed this for anything. ” They all clustered around their science teacher who arrived at their position using a hand held light to find his footing. “ Hey professor, what are stars? ” “ Yeah, how come we can't see them any other time? ” “ Allie could tell you all about them. Where is she by the way? ” “ None of us have seen her today. We figured she was getting a good vantage point. ” “ Stop talking you lot, just look up while it lasts. ” “ Will my phone film without light? ” The teens jostled for space and craned their necks to see all of the once in a century night. The watched the light flow back onto the world as if a giant glowing curtain were being drawn across the land. When they were fully bathed in light again they laughed in release. “ In-cred-ible! ” “ I will see you all tomorrow and you can tell me everything you know about stars in an essay due next class. ” The professor laughed at the half-hearted groans and headed back to the school building. He felt buoyed by a sense of being part of an historic moment and he smiled as he put his key card in the lock of the upper access to the building. The lesser sun bathed everything in a soft yellow glow which would give way to the greater sun and its cold white, in just a few hours. He wished he could enjoy the last few hours of the gold but he had to get some work done before he headed home to keep out of the greater sunlight. Heading down to the underground classrooms he reached his classroom but the lock mechanism seemed to be sealed with some sticky substance. “ Is there someone in maintenance? Someone has tampered with the door pad. Yes I can wait but I do need to finish some papers before Greater sunlight. ” The wait was short and the worker sprayed the lock with an astringent liquid. “ Kids! Doesn't matter where they're from or when, they all get up to some kind of pranks. They must have done it after their last class. Lucky the night happened on the weekend. I will have this cleared in a jiffy professor. ” They stepped through the open door and stopped on the thresh-hold. Every surface of the room was covered in stars. Thousands of them. Cut out stars, painted stars, marker pen stars, crayons, ink, blood. The girl named Crazy Allie, slumped on a seat in the middle of the room. The girl and the chair created an island in the pool of blood surrounding her. It formed a multi-pointed star.",0

"Summary: Some see connection between the Bible and Interstate 35. Believers pray by the side of the highway, which runs through six states. I-35 runs from southern Texas to northern Minnesota. Article: If you turn to the Bible -- Isaiah Chapter 35, Verse 8 -- you will see a passage that in part says, ""A highway shall be there, and a road, and it shall be called the Highway of Holiness."" Churchgoers in six states have held prayer sessions along the side of Interstate 35. Now, is it possible that this ""highway"" mentioned in Chapter 35 is actually Interstate 35 that runs through six U.S. states, from southern Texas to northern Minnesota? Some Christians have faith that is indeed the case. It was with that interesting belief in mind that we decided to head to Texas, the southernmost state in the I-35 corridor, to do a story about a prayer campaign called ""Light the Highway."" Churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside Interstate 35, but the prayers are still continuing. Some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of I-35 being the ""holy"" highway, it needs some intensive prayer first. So we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic Christians prayed on the the interstate's shoulder in Dallas. They chanted loudly and vibrantly, making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on. They prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would ""see the light"" and perhaps close down. They prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate. They prayed that all Americans would accept Jesus into their lives. Watch believers offer prayers ». The woman who came up with the concept of ""Light the Highway"" is a Texas minister named Cindy Jacobs. She says she can't be sure Interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the Bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after ""once again reading Isaiah, Chapter 35."" Jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history, such as the bridge collapse on I-35 in Minneapolis last August and the assassination of JFK 44 years ago near I-35 in Dallas. That's why prayer certainly can't hurt, she adds. Now, it's only fair to say most people, the religious and the non-religious alike, don't buy any of this, but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along I-35. At an adult go-go club, the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others. And he says his club holds fundraisers, food drives and toy drives to help the community. But on the side of the road, the prayerful aren't going to change their minds. Holy highways and nude clubs, they believe, are not a combination God has in mind.",0
"Summary: Official: Streets bustling, workers returning, markets ""back like gangbusters"" Troop surge, citizens groups, Mehdi Army cease-fire all help security situation. Iranian weapons, fighters still posing problems in northeastern Baghdad. Commander says more families will return when basic services fully restored. Article: Attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern Baghdad, prompting a U.S. military officer to proclaim Monday that security there is ""dramatically improving."" Concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of Baghdad, a military official says. People line the streets, cars congest them, trash collectors and other city workers have returned, local leaders are holding community meetings again and ""markets have come back like gangbusters,"" said Army Col. Don Farris, commander of 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division. He added that the largely Sunni al Qaeda in Iraq presence has been ""crushed"" since the beginning of May. However, there are still dangers, most notably the threats posed by Iranian-backed Shiite militants, Farris said. Speaking to Pentagon reporters via video link from Baghdad, Farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation. Among them is the ""surge,"" the additional U.S. troops deployed earlier this year. Watch how old rivalries have been posing problems ». Also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army and the development of a program that employs ""concerned local citizens"" to assist U.S. and Iraqi forces, Farris said. Some of those citizens are members of local Sunni ""awakening councils,"" comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area. Especially in the last six weeks, Farris said, civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests, two Iranian operatives among them. ""From my foxhole, in our sector, it is working,"" he said of the improving security in the area. ""I can only speak to what I see in my sector and I am encouraged."" Farris' sector -- which includes the Sunni-dominated district of Adhamiya and Sadr City, the Shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a ""remarkable turnaround,"" he said. Many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads. Despite improvements in the security situation, Farris warned that ""we still have a lot of work to do"" because there doesn't appear to be any sign that Shiite extremists with links to Iran are halting their activities. Farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators, which are often delivered or manufactured by Iran. Nine such bombs were found in late October, he said. There are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into Sadr City, he said. There are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area, Farris said, because ""essential services"" like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff. Though a ""trickle"" of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return, Farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape. Paul Folmsbee, a State Department provincial reconstruction team leader, said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law, governance, economic development and essential services. Farris' Monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by U.S. and Iraqi military officials over recent weeks. The military officials say they are seeing signs of Sunni-Shiite reconciliation. At a press conference earlier Monday in Baghdad, Brig. Gen. Ed Cardon, deputy commander for support of Multi-National Division-Center, discussed a ""definite period of progress"" in his region on the southern Baghdad outskirts.",0
"Summary: Aid workers: Violence, increased cost of living drive women to prostitution. Group is working to raise awareness of the problem with Iraq's political leaders. Two Iraqi mothers tell CNN they turned to prostitution to help feed their children. ""Everything is for the children,"" one woman says. Article: The women are too afraid and ashamed to show their faces or have their real names used. They have been driven to sell their bodies to put food on the table for their children -- for as little as $8 a day. Suha, 37, is a mother of three. She says her husband thinks she is cleaning houses when she leaves home. ""People shouldn't criticize women, or talk badly about them,"" says 37-year-old Suha as she adjusts the light colored scarf she wears these days to avoid extremists who insist women cover themselves. ""They all say we have lost our way, but they never ask why we had to take this path."" A mother of three, she wears light makeup, a gold pendant of Iraq around her neck, and an unexpected air of elegance about her. ""I don't have money to take my kid to the doctor. I have to do anything that I can to preserve my child, because I am a mother,"" she says, explaining why she prostitutes herself. Anger and frustration rise in her voice as she speaks. ""No matter what else I may be, no matter how off the path I may be, I am a mother!"" Watch a woman describe turning to prostitution to ""save my child"" ». Her clasped hands clench and unclench nervously. Suha's husband thinks that she is cleaning houses when she goes away. So does Karima's family. ""At the start I was cleaning homes, but I wasn't making much. No matter how hard I worked it just wasn't enough,"" she says. Karima, clad in all black, adds, ""My husband died of lung cancer nine months ago and left me with nothing."" She has five children, ages 8 to 17. Her eldest son could work, but she's too afraid for his life to let him go into the streets, preferring to sacrifice herself than risk her child. She was solicited the first time when she was cleaning an office. ""They took advantage of me,"" she says softly. ""At first I rejected it, but then I realized I have to do it."" Both Suha and Karima have clients that call them a couple times a week. Other women resort to trips to the market to find potential clients. Or they flag down vehicles. Prostitution is a choice more and more Iraqi women are making just to survive. ""It's increasing,"" Suha says. ""I found this 'thing' through my friend, and I have another friend in the same predicament as mine. Because of the circumstance, she is forced to do such things."" Violence, increased cost of living, and lack of any sort of government aid leave women like these with few other options, according to humanitarian workers. ""At this point there is a population of women who have to sell their bodies in order to keep their children alive,"" says Yanar Mohammed, head and founder of the Organization for Women's Freedom in Iraq. ""It's a taboo that no one is speaking about."" She adds, ""There is a huge population of women who were the victims of war who had to sell their bodies, their souls and they lost it all. It crushes us to see them, but we have to work on it and that's why we started our team of women activists."" Her team pounds the streets of Baghdad looking for these victims often too humiliated to come forward. ""Most of the women that we find at hospitals [who] have tried to commit suicide"" have been involved in prostitution, said Basma Rahim, a member of Mohammed's team. The team's aim is to compile information on specific cases and present it to Iraq's political parties -- to have them, as Mohammed puts it, ""come tell us what [they] are ... going to do about this."" Rahim tells the heartbreaking story of one woman they found who lives in a room with three of her children: ""She has sex while her three children are in the room, but she makes them stand in separate corners."" According to Rahim and Mohammed, most of the women they encounter say they are driven to prostitution by a desperate desire for survival in the dangerously violent and unforgiving circumstances in Iraq. ""They took this path but they are not pleased,"" Rahim says. Karima says when she sees her children with food on the table, she is able to convince herself that it's worth it. ""Everything is for the children. They are the beauty in life and, without them, we cannot live."" But she says, ""I would never allow my daughter to do this. I would rather marry her off at 13 than have her go through this."" Karima's last happy memory is of her late husband, when they were a family and able to shoulder the hardships of life in today's Iraq together. Suha says as a young girl she dreamed of being a doctor, with her mom boasting about her potential in that career. Life couldn't have taken her further from that dream. ""It's not like we were born into this, nor was it ever in my blood,"" she says. What she does for her family to survive now eats away at her. ""I lay on my pillow and my brain is spinning, and it all comes back to me as if I am watching a movie.""",0

"Prompt: A person has psychic/telekinetic/mind control powers. Based on the distance from the subject they experience lag/jitter/delay. Story: Roughly 7 seconds per 3 paces of distance, that my friend is the best guesstimate I have for the relationship between me and the delay I have to read your thoughts. Here's the thing though, since this process first happened when I was 12 it has been a struggle to live an normal life and blend in with the general public. Can you imagine, sitting in a class to looking at a group of peer ls and them the wave crashes into you, the thoughts and useless wanderings of the mind, other people's minds, flooding into your psyche. To say the least I had a bit of a break down in public and even after two separate therapy sessions with psychiatrist I still was labeled schizophrenic. Everyone wants to think their mind is structured, disciplined, logical, and that somehow everything in the world is reacting to open up that pathway for you to find that magical adventure that leads you to success. Instead, even in the most concentrated of conversations the shit that grabs away at attention is just astounding. For example here is how even the most basic conversation comes out: 'Hey what are you up to tonight' 'Hey how are you' -- OK TONIGHT, WEDNESDAY NOTHING CRAZY IMPORTANT RIGHT 'Doing pretty good, you?' 'Doing well, so what'd you ask' ALRIGHT DO I REALLY WANT TO DO SOMETHING TONIGHT, IT'S ONLY 2PM, AGENDA, SHOWS, RELAX, HUH THERE'S SOME HOPPING BIRDS 'Got any plans tonight, I was thinking about going to catch a movie, $ 6 Wednesday matinee prices for all movies.' 'Oh thanks, he yeah that could be fun' OK OK 6 BUCKS GOT THAT IN CASH SHOULD BE COVERED GAS IN THE CAR OK THERE WHAT ARE WE SEEING WHAT SO THEY LIKE TO SEE UGH DO NOT MAKE ME WATCH A FUCKING FEEL GOOD MOVIE I COULD WATCH FOR FREE ON NETFLIX IN 6 MONTHS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, THEATERS ARE FOR EXPLOSIONS AND AMAZING SOUND I CA N'T GET AT HOME, DID I LOCK MY GARAGE? 'Great, meet you there at 8' 'OK great!' OK WHATEVER THINK OF A BACK UP ESCAPE PLAN IF THE MOVIE SOUNDS DUMB, BROTHER WANTS TO GET DINNER, FAMILY FIRST, NOBODY ARGUES THAT. Now, let's face it people think a lot faster in their minds, than how they speak, in fact you would have no idea how many times you look for words so quickly in your mind and prioritize mentally your conversation. What I always get is a delayed crazed response that sounds like I am talking to a meth head on Red Bull, and that meth head interrupts me while I'm talking in the middle of my sentences. Luckily for me I have a job where this comes in handy, I work internal audit at a financial firm, and you have no idea how fun my job is",0

"Prompt: Sinking Story: When the police arrived, Thomas was already waiting. His hands deep in his pockets, his face red from the cold. ""Over here, officers! ``, Thomas waved his right hand so they would notive him. After the car had stopped two policemen got out, a tall man - without the expected doughnout-belly - and a young woman. Unfortunately she wasn't very attractive, but for once Thomas had something more exciting on his mind then women. They walked towards Thomas, the snow scrunched under their leather boots, and looked around. ""What's the matter, sir? ``, the man began. ""On the phone you told us you had found the most exciting crime scene ever? And that it must have been murder?"" Thomas noticed the doubt and wariness in his voice, but he didn't let it get to him. ""Thats true, why should I lie about that? I can show you, it's right over there! ``, with these words Thomes turned around and carefully walked down the slippery way to his old wooden boat. He took a glance back and noticed, that both policemen followed him. They would be as surprised as he had been! He reached his boat and stopped, holding it with one hand and waving the officers to get in. ""Please, its in the middle of the lake! I couldn't believe it at first, something like this, out here, where everybody knows everybody..."", he stopped talking as he noticed that he didn't know the police officers. ""Well, most of the people know most of the people around here..."", he continued less entusiastic. ""But anyways"", he went on, as he pushed the boat into the water. ""There aren't many murder cases around here, eh?"" The woman raised an eyebrow as she noticed Thomas' cheeky glimpse towards her. Noone answered his question. ""Well, it won't take long, I better be rowing now."" Thomas didn't like the silence, he felt the officers looks in his back. Surely they were thinking he was a madman, only taking a look because it was their duty. Well, soon they would see. As they drew closer to the place, Thomas started talking again. ""You know, this lake is completely frozen during the winter. It started melting about two weeks ago, which is completely normal. I like the peace and the silence, so I bought the boat and come out here often now. Today was my first trip this year, I had a book and some beer with me - wait, there is no'Don't drink and row', is it? ``, he asked jokingly. He turned his head to look into the serious faces of two persons who clearly weren't in the mood for jokes. ""Anyways, here I was"", he pulled in the oars. ""Reading my book, as I wanted to see if there were fish in the cold water at the top."" He stepped to the rail and leaned over. He deepened his voice and saw from the corner of his eye as the officers got curious and moved towards him. ""But what I saw -"", he made a short pause while the officers leaned over the rail to see into the water. ""- scared me to DEATH!"" With the last word he swung the meat cleaver, which sunk deep in the man's head. The body flinched and fell into the water, the woman jumped back, terror in her eyes, and tried to get her pistol from the belt. ""BECAUSE I SAW MYSELF! THOMAS, THE MAN WHO IS HATED, THE MAN WHO HATES, THE MAN WHO LOVES THE SMELL - OF - DEATH!"" The woman couldn't see properly anymore, tears filled her eyes. For the first time in her life she had to pull the gun, but she wans't able to. She saw the blurred madman who jumped towards her, hissing ""Death! Death! Death! ``, and felt cold steel split her chest. Over and over again he hacked her flesh. She didn't even scream. The horror had shut her mouth. As the pain faded away and she felt very tired, she sank back so that her upper body was hanging over the rail. Her last look was towards the grey sky, where the last snow began to fall.",0
"Summary: Zenit Saint Petersburg clinch the Russian Premier League title on Sunday. They secure the title ahead of Spartak Moscow after a 1-0 win at Ramenskoye. The title success is Zenit's first since 1984 and the first in the post-Soviet era. Article: Zenit Saint Petersburg have clinched their first Russian title in the post-Soviet Union era with a hard-fought 1-0 victory at Ramenskoye on Sunday. Zenit captain Anatoly Timoshuk kisses the Russian Premier League trophy after their victory at Ramenskoye. The win means Zenit finish top of the table with 61 points, two points ahead of second-placed Spartak Moscow, who beat city rivals Dynamo 2-1. CKSA Moscow finished third on 53 points. Zenit went ahead in the 15th minute when Radek Sirl's shot from the edge of the box deflected off a Ramenskoye defender and beat goalkeeper Antonin Kinski. After the interval, the hosts poured forward seeking an equalizer and created several chances -- but Zenit held firm to secure their first championship since 1984 and make a hero out of Dutch coach Dick Advocaat. Nine-times champions Spartak took the lead midway through the first-half. Russian international striker Roman Pavyuchenko netted the opening goal in the 24th minute with a powerful shot from the edge of the six-yard box after a mix- up in the Dynamo defence.

"Summary: Justa Grata Honoria plotted to kill her emperor of Roman Empire. When first plot failed, she offered to marry Attila the Hun. He failed to annihilate Rome, or marry her. She then suffered the fate she dreaded. Article: Everyone goes through a rebellious phase. And, if you're lucky, you'll be able to look back on those years and laugh. If you're less lucky, you spent those years on a reality show, so for the rest of time, millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead. In modern times, cats frolic among the ruins of ancient Rome. But, hey, it could be worse. You could be responsible for the fall of Western Civilization, just like Justa Grata Honoria, the Roman princess whose wild ways and (literally) naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the Roman Empire. Barely regal. Smart, conniving, and ruthless, Honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a Roman emperor, except for that pesky Y chromosome. As a young girl, she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother, Valentinian III, was crowned emperor of the Western Roman Empire, while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage. Hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life, Honoria rebelled with aplomb, sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens. Although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal, they failed to satiate her need for attention and power, so Honoria set her eyes on the throne. Employing her ample charms, she seduced her brother's royal chamberlain, Eugenius, and together, they plotted to murder Valentinian and seize power. But, alas, their scheme was soon exposed. Eugenius was executed, and Honoria was sent to a convent in Constantinople. Life as a nun was a fate worse than death for Honoria, but even that couldn't quell her ambition. She spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another. Finally, out of sheer desperation, she turned to sources outside the empire. Her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy Valentinian and risk open war with Rome. Only one man fit that description: Attila, king of the Huns. Attila the hubby. Honoria got the barbarian's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal: If Attila would rescue her, she would marry him, and he would get half of the Western Empire as her dowry. Of course, Honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the Roman Empire. But she was betting that after marrying her, Attila would conquer the whole Empire, and she'd become queen to boot. Attila had secretly been planning a move against Rome for years, and Honoria's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike. Wasting no time, he told Valentinian that he planned to marry Honoria, and demanded the dowry he'd been promised. Naturally, Valentinian refused, and Attila used his status as a ""wronged husband"" to invade Roman territory in 451 C.E. The Hun armies quickly swept through the Empire, destroying everything in their path, and eventually they arrived in Rome. Like all the other cities before it, Rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the Huns during the invasion. Rome survived Attila's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe, the Visigoths, but the Western Empire never recovered. Within a generation, the armies of the Goths, Franks, and Huns had overrun the area. The Princess bride. Ultimately, Honoria became neither Roman empress nor a Hun queen. Attila never rescued her, and she was eventually sent back to Rome and left to her brother's justice. Not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed, and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again, Valentinian settled on a suitable third option. After years of struggle, Honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along: She was married off to an elderly Roman senator, and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history.

"Summary: One dead as hundreds of thousands flee rising floodwaters. About 80 percent of the city of Villahermosa is under water. Tabasco and Chiapas states hardest hit. Authorities say 700,000 affected and 300,000 still trapped by flooding. Article: Heavy rains and flooding have forced hundreds of thousands of people from homes in southern Mexico's state of Tabasco over the past four days, with nearly as many trapped by the rising waters, state officials said Thursday. Officials say about 300,000 people are still trapped by the worst flooding in the region for 50 years. The Grijalva River pushed over its banks through the state capital of Villahermosa on Thursday, forcing government workers to evacuate and leaving up to 80 percent of the city flooded, Gov. Andres Granier's office told CNN. About 700,000 people have seen their homes flooded, with about 300,000 of those still trapped there, Granier's office reported. One death had been blamed on the floods, which followed weeks of heavy rain in the largely swampy state. Tabasco borders Guatemala to the south and the Gulf of Mexico to the north. The Associated Press reported that thousands of people clung to rooftops, huddled inside waterlogged homes or hunkered down in shelters in an attempt to survive the worst flooding the region has seen in 50 years. Weather forecasters predicted more rain in the coming days. The flooding was not related to Tropical Storm Noel, which was pounding the Caribbean. The Grijalva River, one of two large waterways ringing Villahermosa, has risen 6.5 feet (2 meters) above its ""critical"" level and gushed into the city's center, according to AP. Authorities said some of the rivers were continuing to rise. President Felipe Calderon visited the area on Wednesday and promised the federal government's full support. Non-governmental organizations throughout the country asked people to donate non-perishable goods or cash, AP said. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: Ethiopian soldier dragged after battle with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic. Incident recalls 1993 dragging of U.S. soldier through streets of Mogadishu. Washington is concerned Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists. Article: An enraged crowd dragged the body of an Ethiopian soldier through the streets of Somalia's capital Thursday after gun battles with Islamic insurgents killed 19 people, witnesses reported. In a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving Somali militias in which the bodies of U.S. troops were dragged through the streets, crowds Thursday shouted ""God is great"" as they pulled the bruised, bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty Mogadishu neighborhood. The body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern Mogadishu neighborhood of Suqa Holaha, witnesses reported. Nine Ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead. Another battle broke out on the city's south side Thursday morning between Ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. The fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes, on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks. ""Ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us, for some of their comrades have been killed today,"" said Rahma Nor Omar, an elderly woman in the capital. ""They will be like wounded animals."" Witnesses put the death toll from the day's clashes at 19, including Ethiopian troops, insurgents and civilians. Ethiopian troops arrived in Somalia in December 2006 to help a weak Somali government drive the Islamic Courts Union out of Mogadishu and restore a U.N.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy. The Islamists responded by launching an insurgency against Somali government and Ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year. The United States accused the ICU of harboring suspected al Qaeda figures, including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and raised no objections to Ethiopian presence in Somalia. Washington has long been concerned that Somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists, but ICU leaders denied harboring al Qaeda suspects.",0

"Summary: ""Grey's Anatomy"" actress Katherine Heigl has own production company. Star of hit movie Knocked Up"" is getting married. Doesn't go without makeup for fear of ugly photographs. Says shopping for wedding dress is ""grueling"" Article: A hit TV show. An Emmy. A summer blockbuster. A new company. A wedding! Katherine Heigl has every reason to smile for our camera. A star -- and a trio of gorgeous looks -- is born. The Ingénue: ""This is my favorite look of the three just because it's sexy but not overtly so,"" Heigl says. ""I like simple hair and makeup."" There has been a self-tanning mishap. As Katherine Heigl crosses the parking lot of the sandwich shop at the Roosevelt Golf Course at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, she walks stiffly, holding her arms away from her like a paper doll and apologizing profusely for running 10 minutes late. Earlier, she'd sprayed her entire body with self-tanner, which refused to dry. She resorted to having her fiancé, musician Josh Kelley, take a blow-dryer to her (didn't work). So here she is, in a strapless, ankle-length Juicy Couture sundress (donned to accommodate the residual stickiness), fanning herself and wondering how mottled the tan will be when (or if) the lotion ever sets. Not that one bum experience could turn her off beauty products. ""I love everything new,"" says Heigl, 28, who, in addition to being nominated for an Emmy for best supporting actress on ""Grey's Anatomy,"" just started a production company at Fox. ""When I was in Rhode Island filming this summer, I went to Sephora for the first time. It was like my holy mecca."" She recently had her bathroom vanity renovated with a high counter to make more room for the large drawers below that hold her well-organized loot. Then there's her deal with Coty to be the face of Nautica's new women's fragrance in January. Considering this fondness for all things beauty -- as well as Heigl's impressive acting range -- she plays TV dramedy as deftly as cinematic romantic comedy, as in the mega-hit ""Knocked Up"" and next year's 27 Dresses -- it seems natural for her to be In Style's first ever triple-cover girl. These three looks take her from girl-next-door to red-carpet knockout to pixie-coiffed vamp. The star, whom pals call Katie (and Hollywood calls the Next Big Thing), popped out her retainer to talk about makeup, breakouts and what boys like. KATHERINE HEIGL: I'm so sorry, I have to take out my Invisalign before I eat. IN STYLE: Who knew you wore them? I guess that's the point of Invisalign. KH: I got them because of this wonky tooth. I was like, OK, I can't take it. It's awesome because every two weeks you switch to a new retainer. Pretty much the perfect way to describe Invisalign is Netflix for your teeth. IS: Right -- the things we do for beauty. So, how did you like being transformed into three such different looks? KH: It was fun. I was working with such great hair and makeup people. And to have these professionals turning you into someone else is pretty neat. IS: Do you ever go without makeup? KH: There was a time when I would. Now that I get followed by photographers, I'm really paranoid about it. I do not want to be the ""Look What This Celebrity Looks Like Without Makeup"" picture. I'm clearly vain, and I don't need that. Plus, I like products. IS: How often do you go through your drawers and purge? KH: Often, because people send me a lot of stuff now, which is exciting. I love getting those boxes. [Into the tape recorder:] Send me a box of makeup, Stila! When that happens, I feel like I have to clean out and give stuff to my sister, mom and friends because there comes a point of gluttony that I can't accept. IS: How do you think you express your personality through style? KH: I'm a big hair-up person. Last night at work they put my hair in two French braids to keep it flat under the scrub cap. I thought it looked cute and that I could pull it off after I'd slept on it. And ... no. So I thought I could recreate it myself ... no again. As far as clothing style goes, I fluctuate almost as much as I do with beauty products. I like to shop for sweaters -- maybe it's the New Englander in me. I'm building a house in the mountains in Utah, so I tell myself I'm ""preparing"" for that. I like sweaters -- they're like scrubs -- you don't have to suck it in or worry about the bloat. IS: Do you know how you want your hair and makeup at your wedding? KH: I have an idea, but it's so dependent on the dress, and I haven't gotten there yet. My sister is getting married too, so we looked for dresses together. After about five stores I was like, ""I'm done."" Everyone says, ""You just know when you put that dress on."" My sister found the right dress just like that. So I know it can happen. But it's grueling. IS: Wait, so your mom has two daughters getting married within months? KH: My poor mother is probably like, ""Why, God? Why?"" But I hired a planner. I want the day to be spectacular, but mostly I want it to be fun. And I don't want to freak out or stress. IS: Does your fiancé have any particular opinions about your look? KH: Josh wouldn't mind if my hair was brown, if it was still long -- that's such a boy thing. IS: Would you ever wear a wig out? KH: I'd contemplate it, but I don't know if I actually have the courage to pull it off. I once wore a long hair-extension ponytail, and someone asked me if it was real, like I was one of those dolls when we were little, and the hair just cranks out. IS: How would you describe your skin? KH: My skin is sensitive, so everything bothers it. And I'm the jerk who keeps switching products and making it worse. IS: How do you treat a breakout? KH: I got a great product at Ona Spa called Sebuspot. I've tried so many that were disappointments, but maybe I stand too close to the mirror examining my pores.

"Prompt: A Witch attempts to kill the knight who has been hunting her for years by pretending to be a damsel in distress. As she discovers his ultimate weakness, she realizes she has fallen in love with him. Story: ""Alright,"" Cassandra said, checking her face in the pocket mirror. ""Just the right amount of doe eye. Maybe overdid the boobs, but somehow I don't think he'll mind."" Burbank hooted from his perch on the branch next to her. ""I did not,"" Cassandra said indignantly. ""My ass fat wouldn't have filled my chest."" Burbank turned and flew off. ""Fine then, go eat a spoiled rat you ungrateful shit,"" she muttered. The *clop* of horse hooves filled her ears. *Why do you suddenly have butterflies? * Cassandra thought. She cleared her throat, her usual croak rising to a lovely falsetto. ""Hello?"" she cried out in a dainty question, pulling her blouse down just a bit more and angling her legs off to the side of the hanging cage in an uncomfortable position. ""Hello, is anyone there? Won't someone rescue me?"" The sound of the horse came to a stop and silence filled the woods, the crickets and birds sensing something off and staying silent. Sir Rothbar, the fabled Black Knight of Red Mourn stepped from behind a tree and examined the young woman. He wasn't wearing his armor, but had obviously scouted the scene before revealing himself. *You've grown old, Rothbar, * Cassandra thought. *It looks good on you. * Rothbar had indeed gone gray and years in the sun had weathered his face, giving his stern features the appearance of chiseled stone. ""Young Miss,"" his deep voice carried. ""Why are you in a cage in a tree?"" ""Oh, sir, can you help me?"" Cassandra asked, leaning against the wooden bars and working up a tear to fall between her breasts. ""I have been trapped up here for hours. A wicked old woman trapped me here."" ""Was she tall?"" Rothbar asked. ""With a haggish face and a stoop?"" ""Well, I wouldn't call it a haggish face,"" Cassandra said. ""But yes, that sounds like her."" ""Ah,"" Rothbar said. ""She trussed you up here to slow me down. Clever woman, I'll give her that. Well, be patient, I'll get you down."" ""Oh, thank you sir,"" Cassandra said. After some fiddling with the knots of the rope that suspended her in the tree, Rothbar began to lower Cassandra to the ground. He stopped the cage a few feet from the packed earth of the road and cut the bindings of the cage door with a casual swipe of his sword. Gripping Cassandra by the hips, he lifted her effortlessly and set her down. ""Oh, ooh, my you're solid sir knight,"" Cassandra said. ""Thank you. I was ever so sure I was done for. Hardly anyone comes down this road."" ""Well, then Miss,"" Rothbar said. ""Where do you hail from?"" ""Oh my village is up the road a few days,"" Cassandra said. ""You see, I was on my way to the market at the village south of here when that.... that horrible woman captured me."" ""Very well then,"" Rothbar said. ""I will return you to your village before I return to my quest."" Rothbar whistled, and a great black stallion stepped around a tree and approached them. One sniff of Cassandra and it reared. ""Easy, easy girl,"" Rothbar said. ""I'm sorry madame, but he must have the scent of the witch in his nose."" *Shit, I forgot the scent spell, * Cassandra said, and began to mutter it under her breath. By the time Rothbar mounted the horse and offered her his arm, Cassandra smelled like sweet oats and the great beast tried to nuzzle her. ""Oh, what a sweet creature,"" she said. ""Oh, yes, ah hah hah *knock it off! *"" Rothbar hoisted her with one arm behind him and they were off, Cassandra wondering why the feel of him seemed to warm her insides. She leaned back and felt the armor secured on the rear of the horse and smiled to herself. _____________________________________________________________________________ Day one was spent in mostly silence, Cassandra asking a few pointed questions of Rothbar. That night at a campfire she told him her name was Sarah, and she began to tell him of her history. Cassandra found herself telling Rothbar of her evil father and dull-witted mother, of the sister tossed down the well because Father was drunk and had dropped something. She told him many things, her script for the young naive Sarah forgotten as she shared the tale of her upbringing. Day two, Rothbar started telling war stories as Cassandra pestered him. They were grim things, tales of blood and nightmares. That evening he told her of his loving blacksmith father and mother, and how their plague deaths left the boy orphaned. On day three, Cassandra sent up a spell to make it rain, and the road became impassable. In a cave off the road, huddled together for warmth before the fire, Rothbar told her the tale of how he became the squire of the original Black Knight, and how he inherited the legendary armor, it's black metal guarding against all magic even if the knight wasn't currently wearing it, so long as the Black Knight kept himself pure. *Purity, * Cassandra thought with glee. *There it is. * As the evening grew colder, Cassandra drew herself closer to the knight, and with satisfyingly little effort convinced him to break his vow of celibacy. Afterwards, laying together wrapped in Rothbar's cloak in their own sweat, she felt herself dozing in the crook of his arm. ""Is it everything you hoped for, Cassandra?"" Rothbar said. Her eyes snapped open. ""Hmm?"" she asked, feigning sleep. ""Knock it off,"" Rothbar growled. ""Shit,"" Cassandra said, rolling to her feet. ""How long have you known?"" ""Since my horse tried to trample you,"" Rothbar said. ""Sloppy of you. Go back to sleep, we'll settle this tomorrow. It's raining outside and I'm cold."" Cassandra dressed instead, and waited on the other side of the fire, wondering why there were tears in her eyes. Her jaw dropped as she heard Rothbar's snore. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ""Honor demands we duel,"" Sir Rothbar said solemnly, the morning sun shining on the grass outside the cave. Cassandra's eyes woke from unplanned sleep to find him rustling through his armor outside. ""I'm not dueling you,"" Cassandra said. ""We aren't doing this. Put the armor down. Don't you put on that greave. Take that greave off. Don't you put on that gauntlet."" ""You killed my Lord,"" Rothbar answered. ""He was a prick! He murdered people for fun! Your stupid honor had you bound to a psychopath. I did you a favor."" ""I swore an oath,"" Rothbar said. ""I swore it to his father that I would protect him. I couldn't.... I could have guided him on the right path if you hadn't killed him."" ""No you couldn't,"" Cassandra said. ""No one could. You don't have to do this, Roth, you're vulnerable now. I don't want to hurt you."" 'Hah,"" Rothbar said. ""You misunderstood the power of the armor. It isn't celibacy, it's purity as defined by the old charters. So long as I never love anyone but my lord, I am protected. Raise your guard, witch."" Cassandra sighed. ""*Moob*,"" she muttered, and lightning shot from her fingers. Rothbar flew through the air and landed five yards away, his useless armor smoking. Cassandra strolled towards him and stood over his panting form, her arms crossed defiantly. ""Ah,"" he said. ""Bugger."" She looked down at him, pity creasing her face. ""Breakfast?"" she asked. Rothbar contemplated this for a moment. ""Yes,"" he agreed, and she helped him up.",0
"Summary: Two employees bought, sold weapons on their own, company says. Company fired workers, turned them in to ATF, says source. Feds investigating claims Blackwater employees made illegal arms deals. Blackwater in spotlight after shootings last weekend that killed 20 Iraqis. Article: Allegations that Blackwater USA -- whose operations were suspended after 20 Iraqi civilians were shot to death last weekend -- was ""in any way associated or complicit in unlawful arms activities are baseless,"" the company asserted Saturday. Blackwater employees patrol Baghdad by air in a February 2005 photograph. Federal prosecutors are investigating allegations that employees of Blackwater illegally purchased weapons and sold them in Iraq, according to U.S. government sources. A U.S. government official has said the U.S. attorney's office in Raleigh, North Carolina, is in the early stages of an investigation that focuses on individual company employees, and not the firm. Blackwater, which is based in Moyock, North Carolina, is a security firm hired by the State Department to guard U.S. staff in Iraq. ""The company has no knowledge of any employee improperly exporting weapons,"" the Blackwater statement said. ""When it was uncovered internally that two employees were stealing from the company, Blackwater immediately fired them and invited the ATF to conduct a thorough investigation."" Watch a report on Blackwater's response to the allegations ». The first public hint that an investigation was under way came earlier this week in a statement from State Department Inspector General Howard Krongard after he was accused of blocking fraud investigations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Krongard said the State Department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the Blackwater probe. ""In particular, I made one of my best investigators available to help assistant U.S. attorneys in North Carolina in their investigation into alleged smuggling of weapons into Iraq by a contractor,"" Krongard's statement said. Blackwater resumed normal security operations in Iraq on Friday, the State Department said, after a brief hiatus following the lethal incident last Sunday. The Iraqi government was outraged by the shootings and disputes the U.S. and Blackwater's claim that the guards were responding to an attack. CNN's Elise Labott and Kelli Arena contributed to this report.",0
"Prompt: An army approached the pass. Only one being stood in there way. They did not plan to survive, just survive long enough. Story: The march had been long and arduous but they had reached the pass. Tomorrow would be the final day of life for most of the army. The soldiers though had made their peace with God, and knew that what they were about to sacrifice gave the chance of hope for their families to survive. The pass in front of them was the only link with the outside world, the only way for food to come and enter to the valley. That was until the beast appeared. It killed anything that entered the past and the valley had been slowly starving to death due to a drought that killed the harvest. Their only hope was to send messengers to the outside to gain the assistance of a legendary warrior. The army sat around their campfires sharing one last round of somber laughs before tomorrow. The five fastest runners were already asleep ready to prepare for the mad dash they would attempt through the chaos. They carried the hope of all the valley. As the fires died that evening and the stars faded to the morning lights the men awoke ready for death. The men stood, at arms just on the edge of the pass staring at their foe and death. It sat among a pile of bones at the center of the valley at his narrowest point. Its white fur glistened clean a pure, a contrast to the blood of those around it whom it had slain. Its red eyes stared at them glinting of chaos and death. Its nose twitched as if beckoning them to try and kill it. To most it was a rabbit, to those men it was death. A shout traveled down the crowd as they charged the beast. As a white flashed it jumped man to man, killing each with a mighty chomp of its teeth. It was in the middle of the chaos the runners charged, making a beeline through the men swinging frantically at the creature as it killed them each. Four of the runners were felled by the beast, but one made it through the pass. When a few saw their mission a success a general shout of ""Run Away!"" resounded through what was left of the army. Their mission complete what little remained of the army returned home to spread the word of hope. At the opposite end of the valley the last of the messengers looked out at the unknown lands to seek the hero of legend. Who was seemingly unfazed in battle by any wound. The Black Knight shall save his people. *Edit: Fixed Spelling*",0
"Summary: Beckham has agreed to a five-year contract with Los Angeles Galaxy. New contract took effect July 1, 2007. Former English captain to meet press, unveil new shirt number Friday. CNN to look at Beckham as footballer, fashion icon and global phenomenon. Article: Football superstar, celebrity, fashion icon, multimillion-dollar heartthrob. Now, David Beckham is headed for the Hollywood Hills as he takes his game to U.S. Major League Soccer. CNN looks at how Bekham fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, and his time playing for England. The world's famous footballer has begun a five-year contract with the Los Angeles Galaxy team, and on Friday Beckham will meet the press and reveal his new shirt number. This week, we take an in depth look at the life and times of Beckham, as CNN's very own ""Becks,"" Becky Anderson, sets out to examine what makes the man tick -- as footballer, fashion icon and global phenomenon. It's a long way from the streets of east London to the Hollywood Hills and Becky charts Beckham's incredible rise to football stardom, a journey that has seen his skills grace the greatest stages in world soccer. She goes in pursuit of the current hottest property on the sports/celebrity circuit in the U.S. and along the way explores exactly what's behind the man with the golden boot. CNN will look back at the life of Beckham, the wonderfully talented youngster who fulfilled his dream of playing for Manchester United, his marriage to pop star Victoria, and the trials and tribulations of playing for England. We'll look at the highs (scoring against Greece), the lows (being sent off during the World Cup), the Man. U departure for the Galacticos of Madrid -- and now the Home Depot stadium in L.A. We'll ask how Beckham and his family will adapt to life in Los Angeles -- the people, the places to see and be seen and the celebrity endorsement. Beckham is no stranger to exposure. He has teamed with Reggie Bush in an Adidas commercial, is the face of Motorola, is the face on a PlayStation game and doesn't need fashion tips as he has his own international clothing line. But what does the star couple need to do to become an accepted part of Tinseltown's glitterati? The road to major league football in the U.S.A. is a well-worn route for some of the world's greatest players. We talk to some of the former greats who came before him and examine what impact these overseas stars had on U.S. soccer and look at what is different now. We also get a rare glimpse inside the David Beckham academy in L.A, find out what drives the kids and who are their heroes. The perception that in the U.S.A. soccer is a ""game for girls"" after the teenage years is changing. More and more young kids are choosing the European game over the traditional U.S. sports.",0

"Prompt: You have been kidnapped by the mafia, the reason? Someone who 's very high up has a child who has a crush on you. Story: I feel his eyes, always on me, always begging me to turn and look back at him but I can't. I am Bree Tanner the daughter of a very important man. I am destined to get straight A's, graduate valedictorian and continue on to Harvard before taking over my daddy's company. I can't have any distractions especially not Demetri. I was only going to have one drink, then Aryella and I were going to split but the music, the energy and the vodka had another idea. Three drinks later and a silly game of spin the bottle and I haven't been able to forget that kiss ever since apparently neither could he, but it doesn't matter, it would never work between us if my father ever caught me even talking to him, the son of the big boss for the local Russian mob, I would be packed up and sent off to boarding school before his pretty blue eyes could bat an eye. ""Go tell him"" aryella's voice brought me back form drowning in Demetri's wavy brown hair. ""I.... what? What would I even tell him? Hey I think your a total hunk but your kinda a future mobster and I'm going to be a CEO so it won't work out any way!?"" This earned me a laugh and her signature hair flip as she turned a 3 $ cafeteria salad into something that looked like a house Salad for a five star restaurant. ""So are you going to my graduation party?"" Aryella asked excitedly. Before I could answer she began explaining the over extravagant party her father, only second on the wealth-o-meter to my father, would be throwing for her. I nodded along pretending the menu and live band were interesting to me as I imagined another party with demetri, could I risk a few more vodka mixed drinks and a game of spin the bottle? I would be leaving in a few weeks, what's he worst that could happen. The following weeks flew by, before I knew it I was officially a fully functioning member of society and I had the diploma and Harvard acceptance letter to prove it. Soon enough he night of Aryella's party came and here I stood in the 12th dress I've tried on and still not convinced it was sexy enough. The door to my bedroom busted open and not a moment later I was hit in the face with a flashy strapless blue sequence mini dress. ""I'm a Highschool graduate not a cheep hooker, I'm not going to wear this"" Aryella laughed as she strutted around my large room striking various poses in a matching black version of the dress. ""Aww come on it's our last big party together and I wanted us to match! Plus it changes colors!!"" Sure enough when I moved my hand across the sequence it changed from blue to green. ""fine I'll try it on but no promises"" it took me almost five minuets to squeeze shimmery and shake my way into that dress but all that work payed off. This was the dress. With a few beach waves a starfish clip and some black ankle boots I was ready to party. Three hours. The party started three hours ago and he still isn't here. I should be happy, he is a distraction I don't need but that one drunken kiss left me craving more. ""He's a bad boy Bree he's obviously waiting so he can show up fashionably late."" Aryella put a blue vodka jolly rancher drink in my hand. ""Relax have a drink dance a little and soon enough he will be here."" I took a deep breath then a deep drink from my cup hoping my friend is right. Demetri- She looks like a mermaid princess, her long brunette hair curled, makeup applied with precision, dress hugging her body showing off her curves. It's a shame she has to go away. It's a shame she is who she is, daughter of John Tanner. She hasn't noticed me yet but everywhere I go I can't help but notice her. It was a miracle that she sat next to me at rylees party a few weeks back but she haven't looked at me since. Perhaps she hates me, I knew she was drunk when I kissed her but she joined that game willingly, I only wish she would give me a chance while sober. There's only one way to find out. Bree- Some ware between my second and third drink I noticed him, Across the pool standing there in his silent sexy way. But around my third drink I was able to push him to the back of my mind and enjoy myself, after all of it's meant to be it will happen. ""The ocean is that way"" his deep voice snapped me out of my vodka induced dancing. ""Um what?"" ""the ocean, I figured Triton would be wanting his mermaid princess back"" I laughed a little over excitedly at his attempt at a joke. ""I knew blue sequence was a mistake, maybe green is a better idea"" with a quick wave of my arm I turned the better half of my dress green earning me an applaud and requests for an encore. Before long we both found ourself drinks in hand lounging at the top of Aryella's grand staircase. ""So there I was the Mayers two year old daughter in one hand, a priceless family heirloom China plate in the other and we are all covers in mud, needless to say I've never babysat again."" Nearly two hours have gone bye and it's obvious Demetri is good at more then kissing. It's a good thing I'm leaving next week, there's no way I can resist his charismatic charm. ""It's a shame you are going away to college, I would have really liked to get to know you better. ""His eyes focused on my lips as he said that last part and I know exactly what he was thinking. The same thing I've been thinking for the last hour. The time it took his lips to reach mine felt like eternity but the moment our lips touched I thought I had died and gone to heaven. His hand caressed my cheek as he ran his thumb along my jaw. I took ahold of the front of his shirt and lost myself in him. ""BREE ELISABETH TANNER GET YOUR HANDS OFF THAT DELINQUENT AND GET YOUR ASS IN MY CAR NOW!"" Oh shit. Only one person Calls me by my full name and that one person is the last one I want to see right now. I don't even look back, if I see his eyes, the hurt or love or whatever other confusing emotion he might be feeling right now I might break. The carried home is filled with avoider then nessisary sprach about the importance of being home by curfew and how I need to be hanging around people of importance not Russian mobsters. None of it matters, I got my kids now I can fly away to college without Any regrets, or can I? Is this what I want with my life? How have I never asked myself that before. My bags were packed for me, apartment one block away from campus picked out without any consideration on if I would like it or not, my life was no longer my own. It never was my own life, but now it felt like it was stolen. My iPod hummed in my ears, a sweet song Demetri told me I should listen to. As I looked out the window of the plane. I should be landing any Minuit where a driver will pick me up and take me to my Newley refurbished prison, far far away from where I wanted to be. The man in a black suit and tie held up a sign with Tanner printed across it in black letters. Without a word I handed him my bags and followed him to the car wanting nothing more then to go curl up in my bed eat ice cream and call Aryella. The car door shut behind me with a thump. The 45 minute drive to my new apartment was torture. The landscape was beautiful the shops all looked cute and I saw at least three coffee shops I could see myself sitting in and doing homework while sipping on a latte yet I hated it all of it. There was no Demetri or Aryella or pinkies ice cream shoppe for when I had a bad day. The driver pulled up to a charming apartment complex that I'm sure charges my parents more then it's worth and my driver helps me Carry my suitcase to my door. With a tip of his hat he is gone and I am left standing there feeling so alone and very defeated. The mechanisms in the lock clicks as I open the door and there in my over decorated living room is a pair of mischievous blue eyes smiling at me.",0

"Prompt: `` On your right, you 'll see natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters. '' Story: ""On your right, you'll see the natives living along the beach, and they are NOT happy with us being in their sacred waters."" Marcus muttered into an imaginary microphone as we floated on our shamble of a armored rubber raft, now riddled with darts and primitive arrows. The emergency escape pod suffered severe damage on the drop down to planet side. The light weight and heat resistant alloys made for makeshift armor for ourselves and our rubber survival raft. Our only hope was to get out of the territory of these natives and get to the Federation outpost downriver. The ape-like primitives were much akin to gorillas from earth in terms of survival habits. Building ""nests"" in trees, which were more like tree houses that any kid would want, and not being able to swim and just not liking water in general, getting most of their hydration from native plants and fruits. I was to be conducting studies of the primitives, to see if they were viable to learn, be educated, and introduced to the galactic stage. It was doubtful, as my 2 years spent observing them from the Federation Cruiser, the *Iaculum*, proved they they were essentially at their peak of civilization. My colleague had much less respect for said natives however, making constant jokes of giving the peace presents of bananas. The natives walked the shore, matching the pace of our boat in the current, some carrying spiked clubs made from the tails of some native fauna, some with blow guns, others with crude bows. The small rifle was all we had to defend ourselves, should the currents run us aground.They believed that water was a portal from the land of the dead and the land of the living. Anything from the water was, in their eyes, an undead demon trying to escape. Marcus ducked, but no arrows nor darts made impact, but fear crossed his face for the first time ever since I met him. ""Whats wrong?"" I dared to ask. He quickly raised his hands to me making hushing sounds as he returned to listening to the world around us. He peaked his head back up to see over the plating. ""Ooh, that's not good. Issac, do you hear rushing water?"" ""We're in a boat, I'd be more concerned if there wasn't"", I answered, feeling witty. ""The natives stopped following us, and it sounds like it's getting louder. Oh shitsnaps."" Sudden terror and dread filled me upon realizing what he was blabbering about as the noise grew louder.

"Prompt: A cult tries to summon a demon/God but manages to summon you instead. Story: ""Candles; check. Charcoal pentagram; check. Each of our birthstones.... one, two, three, four, five...; che-"" Xander was interrupted by Erik. ""I'm not giving that diamond up for nothing, this better work!"" ""Erik, as grand master of this cult, I assure you that each and every step is being followed down to the very hand-motion and accented vowel. It's going to work."" ""Okay, Xander, then get on with it."" Xander ignites the small black candles at each point of the pentagram, and prepares to light the large red one in the middle. ""Okay,"" Xander states, looking menacingly around the room, ""who wants to write the name of our demon on the parchment?"" After a few silent moments, Allen, a younger member of the cult slowly raises his hand. Xander gives him the blood-dipped quill and the parchment. ""Remember Allen, we are trying to summon Haripetaur. After you write His name, fold the paper into a triangle such that none of the name is exposed."" Allen takes the paper and quill, and begins to write the demons name. H..A..R.....R? Sweat begins to drip down his forehead as he realizes he doesn't know how to spell Haripetaur's name. He knows that the blood bond has begun; stopping now would curse every member of the cult for life. Trying to conceal his terror, he continues to write the name. HARR.... Y..P..O....... TT.... U.... R. Harrypottur. He reads the name back to himself a few times. Harrypottur... Harrypottur... Relief begins to enter his body; he's pretty sure this is the correct way to spell it. Allen folds the paper into the triangle, and hands it back to Xander. ""Okay Allen, you're sure you did everything right?"" With a shaky voice Allen replies, ""Oh of course! Ha... What could I have messed up on?"" ""Okay, well if you're sure, we shall begin the ritual."" At last, Xander lights the large red candle and sparks of all colors blast into the air. Careful to not burn himself, he slowly inserts the parchment into the flame. In an instant the parchment is devoured, and the flames and sparks become a deep blue. Black smoke begins to rise from each small white candle, and the members of the cult back away from the pentagram. The black smoke fills the room until no member is able to see. ""Uh.... hello?"" I call from the middle of the room. ""What.... where am I? What's going on?"" Xander, trembles to his knees. ""Great Haripetaur, we, the Cult of Torath, have summoned you to our world. We are your humble servants; we will do what you request in return for fame, glory, and riches."" The smoke in the room begins to clear and I can see the outline of five or six hooded figures. ""Herep- what? What did you call me?"" I ask, struggling to make sense of this bizarre situation. ""Hereptor?"" There was a moment of silence that seemed almost anxious to end. Xander, slowly rising back to his feet, was beginning to feel that something was off. ""Are you not Haripetaur, one of the six great demons of Ishemnthal?"" The smoke was almost completely dispersed, and the scene was borderline comedic. I was sitting in a charcoal pentagram in my boxers and a tshirt, surrounded by multiple young adults in robes. Each one with a look more dumbfounded than the last. ""I'm sorry, but I have no idea what you are talking about. I was sitting in my room browsing Reddit, when I was suddenly surrounded by black smoke and transported here. Who are you people?"" Ignoring my question, Xander's gaze darted to the youngest-looking member, Allen. ""What did you write on the paper!? I told you to be very certain it was correct!"" ""I.... I forgot how to spell it but I had already begun writing. I couldn't stop!"" ""What did you write!?"" Xander's tone was rapidly darkening, while the volume of his voice was increasing at the same rate. ""H-A-R-R-Y-P-O-T-T-U-R,"" Allen spelled out, concentrating as to not mess up a second time. As he was calling out these letters a train of realization was barreling towards me. ""HarryPottur...?"" I ask. ""That.... That's my Reddit username."" Xander's face was an odd mixture of rage-red, and ghoulish-green, as if his body could not handle the mass mix of emotions he was currently experiencing. He began throwing things around the room, and screaming at anyone in his wake. While this was going on, something odd seemed to be going on with Allen. His back seemed to be.... pulsing of sorts, and is head was beginning to twitch in every direction. ""Uh.... sir, uh... Xander? Something weird is going on with your friend over here."" The worry in my voice was translated to the faces of the cult members, as they began to realize what was going on. Allen had grown a good four feet, and his skin had turned scarlet red. Wings erupted from his back, as hair and nails turned to spiny obsidian. ""YOU DARE SUMMON HARIPETAUR, THE FOURTH DEMON OF ISHEMNTHAL, DESTROYER OF DREAMS AND BIRTHER OF NIGHTMARES, BRINGER OF THE TRUE POWER OF..."" There's no way I heard that last word correctly. Did.... did he just say Bringer of the true power of Oxyclean? ``.... OXYCLEAN TACKLES HOUSEHOLD STAINS- INSIDE AND OUT"" I wake up in a jolt of fear. I see the Oxyclean commercial blaring on my TV, and realize what had happened. It was all a dream. Of course it was. I couldn't be transported to some random cult hideout via my Reddit username. How silly. But.... When I logged on to my Reddit account, I noticed a PM notification. Curious, I open the PM, and immediately regret my decision. The PM reads: Careful when you begin to snore, for I am waiting: number four. Your dreams will be filled with terror and gore, for I am waiting: Haripetaur. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- This is my first WP, and it's 3:00 AM so here goes nothing, also sorry for any formatting issues this was done on my phone.

Out of breath, my knees giving way, it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block. The memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently. After more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction, the bombings and assassinations have returned to Beirut. Every time I hear of a new explosion, I think of a frightened child sitting in darkness. In 1988, I watched the last throes of Lebanon's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of Lebanese, sad, frustrated and often fearful. See a timeline of Lebanon's recent history ». Now I watch from another continent, but I find those same emotions resurfacing. The conspiracies, the car bombs, the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar. The actors are like shadows from a long gone past. They are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination. But the cast in Lebanon's tragedy has changed little in two decades. Then, as now, a presidential election is the setting, and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set Lebanon back 20 years. See bios of Lebanon's major players ». In 1988, the president's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate. Militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building. Compromise was nowhere in sight. The West had abandoned Lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors. Syria had its choice for president; Israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing Muslim radicalism. The country was awash with weapons. In his last act as president, Amin Gemayel named fellow Christian and Army Chief Michel Aoun as prime minister. At a stroke, he shattered the convention that a Muslim hold that position. Muslims refused to serve in the Cabinet and the country ended up with two governments. Aoun famously declared: ""I am prime minister and six ministers in one."" Aoun's ""War of Liberation"" against Syria turned into defeat. Then, he turned on fellow Christians of the Lebanese Forces in the ""War of Elimination."" When that failed, the Syrians drove Aoun to take refuge at the French Embassy. In August 1990, I came to CNN as a World Report panelist. I tried to explain Lebanon's chaos, the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians. I had seen people killed in front of me; children orphaned in seconds, parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins. So when I was offered the opportunity to stay at CNN, I gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy. But almost as I left, the civil war was being laid to rest. The various factions had fought each other to a standstill; Arab governments, supported by the West, helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by Syrian influence. Peace came to Lebanon, but it would be five years before I returned. In 1995, I went back and was stunned. I kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants. I couldn't believe that I could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another. No longer did identity -- Christian, Muslim or Druze -- define where Lebanese could go. People mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble, laughing at the same jokes. It was as if Lebanon's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser. Downtown Beirut, once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes, was rocking to Lebanese pop music. The dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest European fashions and deluxe hotels. Lovers had returned to Beirut's Corniche, overlooking the Mediterranean, for romantic strolls at sunset. But the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a ""pax Syriana."" As anti-Syrian sentiment grew, so did political tensions. On Valentine's Day 2005, the Corniche was once again rocked by an explosion. Former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was killed. The symbolism left me speechless. On the day of love, Lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history. It had been widely expected that Hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of Syrian troops. Suspicion fell on Damascus, which vehemently denied involvement. On March 14, Martyrs' Square became a human sea of demonstrators: Muslims, Druze and Christians alike, demanding the ""truth."" But Hariri's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken Lebanon a generation previously. Even after it withdrew its troops, Syria still had allies in Lebanon. One was Hezbollah, accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of U.S. Marines in Beirut more than 20 years previously. Another was Gen. Michel Aoun; now back from exile, the same Michel Aoun who had defied Syria in 1989, but who now made common cause with Hezbollah against his fellow Christians. Earlier this year I visited Martyrs' Square. The spirit of the Cedar Revolution had evaporated. The place looked like a morgue. Anti-government Hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill. As I passed through, business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair. I wondered if they sensed my disappointment, my pain at watching Beirut bleed again. Lebanon's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago. Once again, the term of the president is approaching its end; there is no agreement on his successor. Suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day. And the questions haunts me: Will the country's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries?

"Summary: Authorities uncover a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. embassy in Baku. The United States has reduced its embassy's operations. Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday. Article: Authorities in Azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical Islamic terror plot against the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Baku, prompting the facility to close its doors to the public Monday, Azerbaijan and U.S. officials told CNN. The Bibi Heybat Mosque, just outside the capital Baku. As a precaution, Britain also shut its embassy in Baku to the public on Monday ""following security concerns nearby,"" Britain's Foreign Office said. The terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside Baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group, two U.S. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for Azerbaijan's National Security Ministry told CNN. U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stressed that the details ""are still unfolding,"" and the threat ""may or may not be"" linked to the Saturday raid. ""There were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the U.S. Embassy there,"" McCormack said, noting that no specific individuals were targeted. Several days ago, an Azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical Islamic group seized four assault rifles, a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of Baku, the ministry spokesman and U.S. officials said. Government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on Saturday in the village of Mastaga, about 20 miles (32 km) northeast of Baku, the spokesman said. One suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep, the spokesman said. Several others are still at large, he added. He said the terror plot also targeted Azerbaijani government buildings. The U.S. Embassy in Baku issued a warden message warning Americans in Azerbaijan to take precautions. ""While there is no information at this time that other American or Western interests in Azerbaijan are being targeted, the U.S. Embassy encourages Americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security,"" it said. Azerbaijan is a former Soviet republic that borders the Caspian Sea, and lies just north of Iran. McCormack said U.S. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in Baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume. He said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on Tuesday, as well. CNN's Igor Malakhov in Moscow, Zain Verjee in Washington and Roger Clark in London contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Navy says it has lost confidence in officer's ability to command. Crew members on sub disciplined for faking inspection records, Navy says. Ten people have been relieved of duty; six received ""nonjudicial punishment"" Article: The commander of the nuclear-powered submarine USS Hampton has been relieved of his command amid an inquiry into misconduct by crew members, the U.S. Navy said Friday. The USS Hampton appears in an undated photograph. Cmdr. Michael B. Portland lost his post ""due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command,"" the Navy said in a statement. Cmdr. William J. Houston will replace Portland. The crew neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of chemical levels associated with the cooling system of the ship's nuclear reactor, Navy officials said. The crew then went back and falsified existing records to make it appear the work had been done. ""There is not, and never was, any danger to the crew or the public,"" the Navy said. Portland's demotion brings to 10 the number of people relieved of duty on the submarine in the wake of the misconduct probe. Six personnel have been punished for forging inspection records for the cooling system, the Navy officials said Monday. Those six -- one officer and five enlisted personnel -- received a ""nonjudicial punishment"" after other Navy personnel discovered their actions, the officials said. The Navy said Friday that one officer and two enlisted crew members have been temporarily reassigned to Submarine Squadron 11. Portland also will be temporarily reassigned to that squadron. The misconduct was discovered September 17 but not made public until after completion of an initial inquiry. A fact-finding investigation is under way, and further action against Navy crew members is possible, a Navy official said. The Hampton remains in port in San Diego, California. In all, the $900 million vessel's crew includes 13 officers and 116 enlisted personnel.",0

'Holy hell, where am I' thought Lee. He was sent back in time to 1963 to prevent the assassination of JFK. Something must've gone wrong. Then he got a message on his Time-Watch. It was supposed to look just like a regular watch of the period he was sent to but only he could see the messages that popped up. On the screen it read:'Lee, we screwed up, we can't get you out until'64. P.S If you're not dead before you read this, you're about to invade Normandy with the US in 1944.' ""Go! Go! Go!""

Lee looked over to a dead United States rifleman. He picked up the dead mans M1 and his helmet.'I need a plan. They can't help me until'64 I'm back in'44. Guess I have to sit through this and not get killed.' He turned back to see a few soldiers advancing to a small hill line right before the German gun emplacements.

"Prompt: You come home from work and find a stranger in your home. After a brief panic, you come to find that said stranger is your beloved pet turned human. Story: It was in the evening, I got a call on my voice mail while working. I'm a hotel manager, and the police know me from our nights of belligerent or uninvited guests. I live alone and no one visits since I moved to a rural town. ""Mr. Smith? This is Kerry down at the station. We found a troubled man outside your home, with a dog collar on with your name and phone number. He keeps repeating your name. If you could get down here and help us find out who he is would be great."" I didn't know anyone who would be in town to visit. Let alone someone wearing a dog collar other than my Black Lab named King Louie. So, I ask if the two front desk if they got it for the rest of the evening, and leave the hotel at 6 p.m. I get into the station and they escort me to a holding room, on the other side of the glass is a fit black man in sweat pants. ""We barely got him into the pants, he kept howling and saying'Luther'."" Kerry looking forward, ""if you like you can see him."" ""I don't even know this man."" ""Well, we tried to get off his collar but he bit Walter. We just figured he was a troubled man"", the man started sniffing the air, scurrying towards the glass. ""Luther?!"" He shouted in a deep voice, ""LUTHER!"" Curious and scared of a fit black man calling my name, I work up the courage. I knock on the door and walk in. ""LUTHER!"" He shouted and knocked me to the floor. His tongue was surprisingly long. He placed his fists on my shoulders and I could feel his knees digging into my stomach. ""Oh Cripes. Up boy!"" I said like a knee jerk reaction. ""So you do know him?! Is he your lover? I'm not judging but we just couldn't find any prints on him or..."" ""No, I do not know this man.""

"Summary: GEO-TV president: ""It seemed very obvious that they were going to do this"" Order comes on the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer varied programming, including news. Both networks transmit from the United Arab Emirates. Article: Two Pakistani television networks that transmit from Dubai in United Arab Emirates were ordered off the air Friday at the request of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, officials from the networks said. Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has been under pressure to lift a state of emergency. GEO-TV and ARY Digital offer a variety of programming, including news, entertainment, sports and music. Both networks had been banned from Pakistan's cable television system -- along with other networks, including CNN and BBC -- since Musharraf declared a state of emergency on November 3. This latest action prevents the two Pakistani networks from broadcasting worldwide via satellite. ""This was basically our window to the world, GEO President Imran Aslan said. ""In Pakistan, we've been shut down since the 3rd."" The action was not wholly unexpected, but surprising nevertheless, Aslan said. ""We uplink from Dubai, never having had a license to uplink from Pakistan,"" he said. ""Dubai is a media city which seemed to be a haven and a sanctuary."" Aslan said network officials have been in discussions with Pakistani government officials and ""it seemed very obvious that they were going to do this. We were ready for it to a certain extent."" ""Eventually they decided to put their feet on the pipe, as it were."" The government has made numerous demands of the network, although none of them official, Aslan said. ""It's done through intermediaries,"" he said. ""[Dulling] down the content, not having certain anchors, some of the hosts of our programs and talk shows."" Musharraf's emergency order put several restrictions on the media, preventing journalists from expressing opinions prejudicial to ""the ideology ... or integrity of Pakistan."" Journalists are also restricted from covering suicide bombings and militant activity and could face three-year jail terms if they ""ridicule"" members of the government or armed forces. Almost a dozen journalists have been arrested. Musharraf has denied that his restrictions bar criticism, saying they only ask for responsibility in reporting. But last week, Pakistan expelled three print journalists for using language in an editorial that a Pakistani official called offensive to Musharraf. The editorial criticized Musharraf and the United States and Britain for continuing to support him. While many Pakistani journalists have protested the restrictions, some smaller television channels have complied with the government's restrictions. GEO and ARY have refused. ""It seems most of the other channels have kowtowed in order to survive,"" Aslan said. Musharraf has said the emergency order improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections, which he has said he would like to see take place before January 9. The exact date will be set by Pakistan's Election Commission. Opposition leaders have accused Musharraf of declaring emergency rule to keep his hold on power and avoid an expected court ruling that would have nullified his election victory in October.",0
"Summary: Polish diplomats brought pointed shoes to Britain in 1300s. A female runner sewed two jock straps together for first sports bra. Men wore earrings in Egypt in 1500s. Article: Why shoes are called ""pumps"" and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love. So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show ""Sex and the City,"" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed ""crackowes"" or ""poulaines"" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born. The coeds founded the company Jogbra a year later, garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere. Almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually. Real Simple: Best bras for every figure. Is there a real Mary Jane behind Mary Jane shoes? Not quite: The most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in ""Buster Brown,"" a children's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s. Mary Jane was either Buster Brown's sweetheart or sister, depending on which source you consult. What's the connection between Shakespeare and raincoats? Gabardine, a water-repellent fabric invented by Burberry, got its first mention from Shakespeare. The Bard used the word in The Merchant of Venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms. During World War I, British officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original Burberry trench. Who was the first person known to have pierced ears? No one knows who originated the style, but there's evidence that as early as 2500 B.C. Sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops. And guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy: Men have been wearing earrings since ancient Egypt, where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 B.C. Real Simple: Best way to clean jewelry. What was the inspiration for Lilly Pulitzer's colorful printed dresses? Bored Palm Beach socialite Lilly Pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time, but she found one drawback: The citrus concoctions discolored her clothes. She instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains, and the ""Lilly"" design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born. The style was an instant hit with customers, who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice. How did pumps, stilettos, and sneakers get their names? The term pump first popped up in 1550 in England, where male servants sported the style. It is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump. The word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore ""sneaky."" The modern usage of stiletto, a Renaissance-era Italian word for an assassin's narrow-bladed knife, made its debut in 1953. The word turned out to be especially appropriate, because the shoes' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors. When did folks start toting around umbrellas? For thousands of years, in such places as Egypt, China, Japan, Mesopotamia, and India, umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun. (When it rained, the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs.) Umbrellas weren't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. And another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight, portable, and available to average Joes. Have bikinis always been so popular? Hardly! Named for the nuclear-testing site Bikini Atoll, the suits first appeared in 1946, but American women thought them immodest. Not until the 1960s were they accepted, possibly helped by the hit song ""Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini."" Were French cuffs really created for the battlefield? It is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat. But, in fact, French royalty invented the style in the 1500s, when flowing sleeves were the rage; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners. Amusingly, the competitive English tried to take credit for the fashion, which to this day they refer to only as ""double cuffs."" Have women always carried purses? Once upon a time, ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing (sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack) and accessible through slits in their skirts. Around 1800, thinner, silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue, and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections. The solution? They began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead. Why is underwear nicknamed ""drawers""? In the 16th century, drawers became a common term for both men's and women's underpants. Made of linen, the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable (this being well before Victoria ever had a secret; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century). Most likely, underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body.

"Summary: ""Heartbroken"" house owner's daughter among six survivors hospitalized. One survivor jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape. University of South Carolina mourns deaths of six students. Article: The owner of a North Carolina beach house where seven college students died in a weekend fire said Monday that his family's ""lives were just changed forever"" by the tragedy. Chip Auman said his 18-year-old daughter survived the fire but was hospitalized and in stable condition because of complications from smoke inhalation. ""The thought of losing a child is unimaginable to me, and as a father my heart goes out to the families that lost a loved one in this situation,"" he said. Auman said the situation was ""hard to fathom."" ""There's just no words to describe what we've been going through,"" he said, asking for prayers for survivors and the families of those who died. ""We're numb, we're confused, we're heartbroken."" Two college campuses mourned Monday. Six University of South Carolina students and a Clemson University student died in the fire early Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. Six other South Carolina students were able to get out of the house in time. The six were treated and released from nearby Brunswick Community Hospital, but Auman's daughter was hospitalized again in Hartsville, South Carolina. Authorities from the state Bureau of Investigation and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith said the house was ""engulfed"" in flames when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after being notified. The flames shot into the sky and ultimately left little more than portions of the framing. Fire officials do not believe foul play was involved. Watch a neighbor's video, fears of fast-burning fire ». Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs for the University of South Carolina, said investigators have said it would be Tuesday or Wednesday before the identities of the victims are confirmed publicly. It could be as much as a month until investigators know the cause of the fire, Pruitt said. The university did not cancel classes on Monday, but Pruitt said arrangements had been made for those who need to go home or stay out of class at the 28,000-student campus. Pruitt said meetings had been held Sunday with members of Delta Delta Delta sorority and Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. The South Carolina students were affiliated with those houses, he said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. He also said counselors and ministers were available to help students deal with the loss of their classmates. The university president, Dr. Andrew Sorenson, contacted the families of those who died in the fire to express the condolences and support of the university community. Jay Laura, student president of the USC chapter of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, said the campus would pull together after the tragedy. ""If any place can come together to help in the healing process and the aftermath of an event like this, it is South Carolina,"" Laura said at a Monday afternoon press conference. Fire survivor Tripp Wylie, a 20-year-old South Carolina sophomore, said he jumped out of a third-story window into a canal to escape the flames and was unable to get back in to help his friends. ""I could see a buddy of mine off to the left who had gotten out. He was just yelling at me to jump and stuff,"" Wylie told CNN affiliate WYFF. ""The smoke was pouring out, couldn't really breathe, so I had to make a quick decision. [I] just kind of leaned out the window and luckily I jumped far enough to make it into the canal."" Neighbors flocked to see the fire as firefighters battled and ultimately got the blaze under control. See the scenes of devastation ». George Smith, who lives across the street from the house, said he heard sirens between 6:30 and 7 a.m. and went outside to see ""the whole sky lit up."" ""The whole house was completely engulfed in flames, up to about 20 feet,"" he said. ""I have never seen [a fire] move so fast."" George Smith said the house's occupants were ""partying in there yesterday and into the night."" After about 10:30 p.m. Saturday they quieted down, he said. Linda Sing said she was walking her dog when she saw the fiery destruction. She noted that firefighters had saved an adjacent house by spraying it down with water. ""We knew there were people in there, but we hoped and prayed they'd gotten out,"" Sing said. ""This is the worst thing I've ever seen. We've had hurricanes, but this is worse.""

"Summary: Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 in South American qualifier for 2010 World Cup. Juan Roman Riquelme nets twice as Argentina win third successive match. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez quits after 5-1 loss against Paraguay. Article: Juan Roman Riquelme scored twice as Argentina beat Bolivia 3-0 to notch a third successive victory in the South American qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup on Saturday. Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina. Argentina next travel to Colombia on Tuesday, when winless Bolivia have an away clash with Venezuela. In other South American qualifiers, Colombia beat Venezuela 1-0, and Paraguay routed Ecuador 5-1. Ecuador coach Luis Fernando Suarez, a Colombian, quit after his team's loss saying: ""I have taken the irrevocable decision to resign.""",0
"Prompt: You are a Jedi Padawan, crafting your Saber. However, you get a ... different saber. You are the Jedi of the Rainbow Saber. Story: I looked down at my work with pride. I had crafted a set of tonfa, or guard shoto sabres, aiming to play to my strengths. While capable, my swordplay was not at its finest, and anything that gave me a chance to block my opponent would give me an advantage. And while I'd never admit it, there was a small part of me that hoped the weapons being wielded by a Jedi who did NOT turn to the dark side would bring some honor back to them. My master wasn't pleased with my choice, I knew, but he understood why I had made it. I'd finally finished, and so, now was the time to put my work to the test. I picked up the tonfa, feeling the hilt run down against my arm as I gripped them by the second 90 degree handle that came out from the hilt. I made a few maneuvers, they felt good in my hands. Light, easy to use. Now for the light. I turned it on, and they lit up. White at first, but then I watched as they suddenly became segregated sections of color. Rainbow color. I looked like I was holding up a sign in night time Mos Eisley. As I stood there, I was unable to figure out what had gone wrong. I turned them off, and began to open the casing, checking wiring, looking in at every aspect, down to the Kyber crystals. Everything looked fine. Ok, lets try again, I thought to myself. Once again I closed the casing, and turned them on. Again, the rainbow shone brightly. ""Fuck."" I uttered the human curse word out loud, another thing I'd picked up from my master when he occasionally lost his cool. How in the name of the force would any Sith, any trooper take me seriously with a rainbow blade? As I stood staring confused at my blades, the door opened and in came my master. He stopped and looked my blades up and down. ""While I agreed to say nothing about the tonfa, I must speak in regards to the blades."" He said, placing his words carefully. ""It's not on purpose. I don't.... I have no idea what I've done wrong, Master Cairnwick."" I looked up at him confused. ""I've checked both over and everything is all working. Blades aren't supposed to be rainbow are they? Who's going to be scared of a rainbow sabre?"" I asked. I'd heard or green, blue, red, hell, even purple, but never rainbow. Master Cairnwick gestured for one of the blades, and he held it by the hilt, staring at it as if trying to will it to go to a solid colour, instead of the seperate bands I currently had. ""It is not the colour of our blade that matters, no matter how unusual, Padawan. It is what we do with it that counts. It is whether we use it to defend, or to destroy. To hurt, or to help."" ""Yes Master."" I nodded my head as he handed it back. ""However.... I don't really know how we can stay hidden with a rainbow blade. It's really going to draw attention to us. Perhaps just stick to using the force until we get it sorted?"" He said, looking at me with what looked like sympathy. I nodded agreement, and he left the room. As soon as the doors began to close I heard his long, bellowing laugh echo down the hallway. ""You could have waited till the doors closed!"" I yelled.",0
"Prompt: Sanctuary Story: The lieutenant tried to focus on what was at hand. He tore off his armor, each piece turning to dust as he placed it in the temple of his Lord. The air smelled of perspiration and blood, stinging his jet-black skin, yet he continued. He began chanting, and as he sat chanting the verses of his Lord, his skin began to turn a beautiful white, his eyes lost their fire and colored themselves dark blue, and his hair immediately grew thick and lustrous, though still covered in blood. His large muscles buried themselves within his body, and every visible part of him that was once cruel and abhorred became good and pure. Looking out from the temple, he saw that the fortress had been overrun, and his defiant and chaotic Lord, was now set in chains, to be banished beyond the gates of memory and time. He approached the opposing emissary in his most beautiful form.... ""I'm here, and accept surrender"" ""Pardoning you is beyond my power, Gorthaur.... you must return with me to be judged and face your punishment for your service to The Enemy"" said the emissary, his words striking the holes in Gorthaur's deception. In the face of defeat, and utter doom, the lieutenant bellowed ""NO!"" and the light of his body quickly gave way to his master's former darkness, striking terror into the hearts of those around him. With whispers, he slowly turned to dust, and disappeared. Never to be seen again by those who still lived and remembered his terror and deception. Edit: try to guess where this is from =)",0
"Prompt: You are repeating your day Groundhog style, except every day one more person in the world joins the loop. Story: You wake up to the shrill beeps of your alarm clock. You dread this part of the day. It always takes you ages to get up - which, realistically, is about 20 minutes. Another day begins. After forcing yourself to wake up, you do the normal routine. You get prepared and walk to the bus stop. The bus stop looks like it always does. Standing there are your friends, Ben and Tim. They are once again on their phones, while consecutively arguing about the other's taste of music. It's just another day. You arrive at school and quickly head to your math class. Waiting there are some more of your friends, but no words are exchanged. Everyone is tired. It's Monday, and everyone dreads the week to come. You go through other classes, and finally go home. You're exhausted. You set an alarm, for just an hour - you drift off to sleep.... You wake up to the shrill beeps of your alarm clock. It's dark. You realize that the other alarm must not have worked, your phone must have died or something. You look towards where you placed the phone, and it's gone. Strange. You search around, until you find it where you'd usually place it, on your desk. Either way, you dread this part of the day. It always takes you ages to get up - which, realistically, is about 20 minutes. Another day begins. After forcing yourself to wake up, you do the normal routine. You get prepared and walk to the bus stop. The bus stop looks like it always does. Standing there are your friends, Ben and Tim.

Waiting there are some more of your friends, but no words are exchanged. Everyone is tired. It's Tuesday -- - wait. You glance up to the whiteboard once again, and sure enough, it says Monday. Your math teacher, Mr. Clarke, isn't one to keep the board disorganized. It's always updated when you get there. You walk over to Mr. Clarke to alert him of the board's inaccurate information. Mr. Clarke tells you to go back to your seat. It is Monday. You're a little bit alerted now. You learn the same things you learned yesterday, in every class. You are very alerted. Nobody else seems startled by this. Everyone says the same thing they did yesterday at the lunch table, and you once again head home. You sit in your room, pondering on what happened. Maybe you had a vision of today, in your dreams? Maybe something supernatural occurred. You're not this kind of person, but nothing else would explain this situation. There's no way you actually went through a day twice - right? Every day, you start doing new things. You talk to different people, you try different things. Nothing you do matters. You start doing things you would have otherwise been scared of doing - first you ask a girl out, then you steal things. You eventually steal and try to drive someone's car. You died a few times, but you only wake up in the morning again. How many days has it been? You don't remember anymore. Today, you notice Ben and Tim talking about different things at the bus stop. Today they're arguing about which fast food restaurant they prefer. Is it finally a new day? You eagerly check your phone, but it's still Monday. Things are actually starting to get strange. It's not another day. ""Hey,"" you say as you make your appearance at the bus stop. You wonder if someone will say something different. ""Hey, Chris,"" Ben says. You reply, ""Mondays are awful, aren't they?"" You attempt to have him say otherwise. ""Monday? It's Tuesday."" Ben attempts to contradict your statement. You know something's up. ""It's not Tuesday, look at the date."" Ben looks at his calendar, and for a second, you see a slight look of discomfort on his face. The bus pulls up, and you go to the closest empty seat. You don't have any classes with Ben, so you have to talk to him tomorrow morning. The next morning, Ben stands at the bus stop, with an increased, stronger look of discomfort. You pull him to the side, and say to him with a muffled voice, ""How is your third Monday going?"" Ben looks back at you. He whispers back, ""How do you know?"" ""Uh, it's a bit of a strange situation. Listen, uh, school isn't worth going to at this point. You know what I mean? Let's go to my house, I can explain it there."" You and Ben run off, Tim unaware of the situation, captivated by his phone. You explain the situation to Ben, and your discoveries so far. You can't die, you can't escape, and it never seems to end. Ben seems to understand, or at least slightly understand. You don't know what to do now, but at least both of you are in the loop. Ben asks, ""are there others?"" ""Uh, I haven't seen any others. You're the first one who was off schedule, or at least who I've seen. It would make sense if there were others, though."" Ben nodded. ""So what should we do now?"" ""I don't know. I've just been living this day, over and over. I wonder what's causing this,"" you reply. ""Hmm."" ""Well, I guess we could try to put this to good use. Let's look on the news, or a blog, or something. Maybe there's reports of similar situations,"" you suggest. ""It wouldn't be on the news. Who would report that?

"Summary: Re-designed Fuji Speedway to host its first Japanese Grand Prix since 1977. Suzuka to alternate with Fuji from 2009. Computer models used to prepare teams for the unfamiliar circuit. Article: There are some circuits that are cornerstones of the Formula 1 calendar: the Monacos and Silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers. Then there are the newer circuits -- Malaysia and Bahrain, for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins. Fuji Speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view. Next week they have something completely new to contend with: a track that has yet to see a single F1 team put in a single lap. The Japan Grand Prix is to return to the Fuji Speedway, a circuit that hasn't seen an F1 race since 1977 (though now with a substantially different track layout). The Fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games. The old Fuji Speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game Pole Position (released by Namco in Japan and Atari in the rest of the world). The most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of Mount Fuji, Japan's tallest mountain, looming in the distance. Though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies. The Suzuka track -- which had held Japanese Grands Prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike, but for this year and the next the Japanese Grand Prix will be held at Fuji. However an announcement by Formula One Management (FOM) this month revealed that Suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the Japanese Grand Prix alternating yearly between Fuji and Suzuka after that. Behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with F1 connections -- Honda owns Suzuka, Toyota owns Fuji. Toyota is a relative newcomer to F1 but, having this year surpassed General Motors as the world's number one automobile manufacturer, and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock (a position that hasn't been reflected in sporting success), it is not without clout. The redesign of the Fuji track was carried out by Hermann Tilke in 2003. Tilke, a German architect redesigned a number of F1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including Malaysia, Istanbul, Bahrain and Shanghai, and the tracks for 2008's debut grands prix in Singapore and Valencia. So how do F1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as Fuji without data from previous races to fall back on? The answer lies with computer simulation. Computer-aided design (CAD) is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars. Every bend, every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself. Despite never having raced on the circuit, the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual Fuji Speedway for some time. BMW Sauber's simulation experts received CAD data from the Japanese race organizers late last year. And when their cars arrive at Fuji for testing next week, their race set-up should be close to optimum. The circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments. The radius of each individual segment was measured, allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line (the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance). Then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated. The slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car. ""In order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend, we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels, gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance,"" says Willy Rampf, Technical Director of the BMW Sauber F1 Team. Dieter Glass, Chief Race and Test Engineer with Toyota F1 explains:. ""You start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit. Once you know that, you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce, before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions. ""Getting a bit closer to the weekend, you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy. This prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track, like the degradation of the two Bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time. If you have more fuel in the car, this affects your lap time, but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried."" One peculiarity of the Fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight, which at 1.475 km (0.916 miles) will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but, after the straight the track is relatively twisty. The teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight, and the best grip decelerating into the bends. ""You have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip,"" says Glass, ""and as always you want good grip in general, but you have to balance that with the long straight, where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed."" The testing may be virtual, but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair's breadth away from real world eventualities:. ""Our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values,"" says Rampf. Not that everything can be predicted: ""I think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race,"" continues Glass. ""Many incidents can happen, which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy.""",0
"Summary: ""Wine Library TV"" Internet show has about 40,000 regular viewers. Show takes irreverent look at wine business. Wine consumption has risen in United States for last 15 years. Article: Voluble Gary Vaynerchuk, 31, the host of ""Wine Library TV,"" an online video show, has been known to lick rocks, suck leather and eat dirt while on camera, all to illustrate the unique properties of wine. ""Wine Library TV"" host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show. Of a ""wild and gamey"" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, ""Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile."" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers. Across the Internet, budding wine geeks are discovering a burgeoning number of Web sites, blogs, bulletin boards and other outlets that preach the gospel of the grape in terms they can understand. About 40,000 Internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with ""Wine Library TV."" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject. Yet he stuffs his patter with sports and pop-culture references -- and the kind of language a Wine Spectator critic would be unlikely to employ. The mission of wine sites like ""Wine Library TV,"" say several of the people behind these new outlets, is to demystify wine (and in some cases, sell it, too). Using the language, attitude and new media that appeal to a young, tech-savvy generation, they advocate trusting one's own palate rather than obeying powerful wine critics. Some of the sites also provide opportunities for average wine drinkers to share their opinions. One site, SavorEachGlass.com, declares its dedication to ""exploring the spirit of wine for a new generation,"" with reviews, online journals and essays that explain the finer points of winemaking -- all with attitude. ""The (wine) establishment is about ratings and 'reputation,'"" says the site's founder, Tynan Szvetecz, 29. ""It's about collecting the 'good' stuff as defined by someone else's palate and tastes. That bores a younger generation."" ""We're not afraid to be smartasses,"" he continues. ""We make fun of ourselves, old-world wine makers, new-world wine makers, and anyone else we can get our hands on."" In the U.S., interest in wine is exploding. While consumption has leveled out in traditional wine-producing countries such as France, Italy and Spain, especially among young people, it has trended upwards in the U.S. for 15 straight years. The U.S. is projected to overtake No. 2 Italy by the end of 2007, according to the annual report The U.S. Wine Market: Impact Databank Review and Forecast a leading industry trade publication. Many of the new converts to wine are the so-called Millennials, the under-30 age group coveted by beverage marketers and so comfortable online that they're also called iGen, or the Internet Generation. One of the wine Web sites targeting a younger demographic is VineSugar.com, which features a blog called ""Wine Burps."" ""We love wine but hate the elitism,"" writes founder, Ryan O'Donnell. ""After all, it's just grape juice."" With rants about wine tasting fees, a feature spotlighting ""wine hotties"" working at California wineries, as well as interactive maps that plot and rate wineries, VineSugar.com leaves little doubt about its target audience. CellarTracker.com, an online wine community, appeals to more established wine collectors. The site provides free software -- designed by Eric LeVine, a fortuitously named former Microsoft software developer -- that allows wine enthusiasts to create an online inventory of their wines. The 39,000 users (who count 6 million bottles in their virtual cellars) post reviews of their wines and access scores and other data via PDAs and cell phones. Community tasting notes shed light on how cellar-worthy wines are evolving, helping others decide when to crack open a treasured bottle. Corkd.com, another online community of wine fans, already had 40,000 users when Vaynerchuk purchased the site last year. The free service allows users to catalog and review wines. Instead of having ""friends"" as on Facebook, members identify ""drinking buddies"" and check out what they're drinking. In the growing presence of wine fans on the Internet -- newbies as well as connoisseurs -- Vaynerchuk sees a movement. ""They're part of forums, they meet up (offline),"" he says. ""It's about bringing people together. It's all that's right about wine."" Vaynerchuk should know. The 300-plus shows he has taped in the past two years have developed a cult following of online fans, who call themselves ""Vayniacs,"" share wine tips and obsess about their hero on the site's forum. On a recent rainy afternoon, Vaynerchuk barreled, unrehearsed and unscripted, through a 20-minute show in a single take. He wrapped up Wine Library TV episode No. 337 with what has become his signature line. ""You, with a little bit of me, we're changing the wine world, aren't we?""

"Summary: Singapore Airlines A380 superjumbo completes historic maiden flight. Luxury first class cabins have separate leather seats and double beds. One passenger paid $100,000 for the first Singapore to Sydney trip. Article: It was two years late and billions of dollars over budget, but this week the Singapore Airline-owned A380 completed its maiden passenger journey between Singapore and Sydney. Making history: the first double bed on a commercial jet. On board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience. This was a turning point in aviation history as Airbus' superjumbo became the world's largest aircraft. And the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration. Singapore Airlines' CEO, Chew Choon Seng named the jetliner the ""queen of the skies"". Tom Enders, CEO of Airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds. And CNN's Richard Quest, who was on board the maiden flight, said there was ""nothing quite like it"". The luxury on board, he said, sets a new standard for air travel. It's the quietest large passenger jet ever built (inside and out), it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions, it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort. But the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the Singapore Airlines A380 is its ''beyond first class"" cabins. Behind the sliding doors of the Singapore Airlines Suites, the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading French yacht designer, Jean-Jacques Coste. There's a wide leather seat and alongside that, a standalone bed. This is two meters long with Givenchy duvets and cushions. And for couples traveling, the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds. From bed or chair, travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen LCD. Laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a USB ports and access a suite of office tools on Singapore Airlines' in-flight entertainment system. Celebrity chefs including Britain's Gordon Ramsay and Georges Blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off Givenchy tableware. Unlike other airlines, that have considered offering casinos, gyms and showers on their future A380s, Singapore Airlines has opted instead for a configuration that, whilst offering luxury, also makes money. As Chew Choon Seng, CEO of Singapore Airlines reminded reporters last week, the first Boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash. Behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats, ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks, as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide. Singapore Airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $5.7 billion. The second is due to arrive next February with further deliveries later in 2008. Tickets for the A380's first return commercial flight between Singapore and Sydney were sold at auction on eBay. One passenger paid $100,000 for the experience, with the majority paying between $1,500 and $5,000. The $1.4 million raised has gone to charities in Singapore, Sydney and a global humanitarian organization. From Sunday 28 October, Singapore Airlines will commence its scheduled service between Singapore and Sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction. The jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between Singapore and London's Heathrow Airport. It's been a long road to this point for Airbus, but the journey is by no means over. The airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers (see figures below). Next year it plans to deliver 13, a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010. Tom Enders, Airbus' CEO doesn't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead. ""This is not a piece of cake,"" he told CNN, ""but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers."" It hasn't just been Airbus that has been frantically preparing for the A380 launch. Airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates, as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks. Seventy airports are now ready, Airbus has said. Singapore's Changi Airport, home to the Singapore Airlines A380 fleet, was the first, and when its new Terminal 3 opens early next year, 19 gates across the three terminals will be A380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks. Heathrow's new Terminal 5 will be able to handle four A380s at one time. British Airways, the Terminal's sole occupant, recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants BAA to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to Terminal 5 to accommodate them. As Willie Walsh, BA's CEO told CNN, ""we want to make sure that development is built with the A380 in mind."" But whether the arrival of the A380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided. As CNN's Richard Quest points out, while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly, demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as Boeing's up-coming 787 Dreamliner. As Richard Quest says, ""there's no doubt the A380 will sell, but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount Airbus needs to make money."" But those worries, he adds, are for another day. Thursday was a day for celebration. SOME KEY FIGURES. Orders. Total: 185 orders (165 firm orders) 15 customers.

"Summary: A Mauro Camoranesi goal earns Juventus a 1-1 draw with leaders Inter Milan. Argentine striker Julio Cruz had given injury-hit Inter the lead in the first half. The result maintains Inter's unbeaten record and moves them two points clear. Article: Mauro Camoranesi scored with 13 minutes left to earn Juventus a 1-1 home draw with Serie A leaders Inter Milan on Sunday. Julio Cruz is mobbed by team-mates after giving Inter the lead in their 1-1 draw at Juventus. Camoranesi picked up a headed knock-down from substitute Vincenzo Iaquinta before seeing his shot deflect off defender Walter Samuel to leave goalkeeper Julio Cesar helpless. Inter took a first-half lead when Argentine striker Julio Cruz broke Juve's offside trap and latched onto Brazilian midfielder Cesar's through ball before firing past Gianluigi Buffon. The result means Inter retain their unbeaten record this season, despite injury problems that saw the likes of Patrick Vieira, Francesco Toldo, Marco Materazzi and Dejan Stankovic ruled out. The defending champions are now two points clear of Fiorentina at the top of the table, with Roma a point further behind and Juventus in fourth place. Earlier in the day, Roma missed out on the chance to close the gap on Inter when a late collapse saw them throw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at Empoli. First half goals from French winger Ludovic Giuly and Matteo Brighi had put the visiting Romans in charge and for more than an hour they looked set to cruise to victory. But with 23 minutes remaining Ighli Vannucchi reduced the deficit and Sebastian Giovinco snatched an injury time equaliser to deny Luciano Spaletti's injury-depleted team. Siena snatched a share of the spoils from Parma in a 2-2 draw as Daniele Galloppa scored in the last minute while Napoli needed an injury time goal from striker Ezequiel Lavezzi to deny rock-bottom Reggina their first win of the season, forcing them to settle for a 1-1 draw in the south.",0
"Question: Assessing joint line positions by means of the contralateral knee: a new approach for planning knee revision surgery? Answer: As a new assessment method, we have suggested to assess the JL by means of radiographs of the contralateral knee. The most precise parameter was found to be the distance between the fibular head and the JL. The level of arthritis, age, gender, visibility of the landmarks, and misalignment did not influence measurement accuracy. This parameter is the first tibia-related landmark for assessing the JL, which advantageously corresponds to the tibia-first technique in revision surgery.",0

"Summary: Real Simple tips can add up to great summer. Best way to catch fireflies starts with easiest to catch. Tip on how not to look like a gladiator when wearing espadrilles. There is a graceful way to get in and out of a hammock. Article: Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer. Lazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening. Best way to cut jeans into shorts -- What better way to declare the start of summer? The key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon. Slip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. ""Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,"" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. ""Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors. Lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match."" Repeat as needed to get the length you want. Ninety-degree days? Bring 'em on! The best way to catch fireflies -- How? With womanly wiles: ""Fireflies blink to attract a mate,"" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B. Dorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. ""Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground. So find a female and watch her blinking pattern. Then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you."" ]A plus: The bugs move slowly, so they're easy to trap in a jar. Punch some holes in the lid and add a little grass and a piece of fruit for moisture. Admire your pretty night-lights till bedtime, then let them go. The best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline? Running on the beach can get you into great shape. Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. ""You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,"" says Guss. ""I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes."" Know your sand. ""In soft sand, one mile is like two,"" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. ""My favorite time is in the evening,"" says Guss. ""The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot."" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights. The best way to get in and out of a hammock -- Everyone looks good lazing in a hammock -- it's getting in and out that's tricky. To make it less so, try these tips from Penny Waugh, a buyer for http://www.hammocks.com/. • Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear. • Gently sit back into the hammock and let it level out. • Swing your legs up and stretch them out. • Lie back. Loll. Sigh contentedly. For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. ""It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,"" says Waugh. ""But it's good for the glutes."" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of ""The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You."" • Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. • Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. • Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk. Just don't cut off your circulation. • For a streamlined leg, make the final tie in the back. Create a more whimsical look by putting the final tie in front with a small bow.

"Summary: France lock Sebastien Chabal cited for a dangerous tackle on Simon Shaw. Chabal faces disciplinary hearing on Monday after incident against England. Sale forward will miss the third and fourth-place play-off is he is suspended. Article: France lock Sebastien Chabal has been cited for a dangerous tackle on England's Simon Shaw during Saturday's World Cup semifinal in Paris. Simon Shaw offloads despite being tackled by Raphael Ibanez, left, and Sebastien Chabal. The Sale Sharks forward will face a disciplinary hearing on Monday after his tackle on opposite second-rower Shaw was noted by citing commissioner Dennis Wheelahan. Chabal started the match on the substitutes' bench, but was brought on in the 26th minute to replace the injured Fabien Pelous during hosts France's 14-9 defeat. If he is suspended, then Chabal will miss Friday's third and fourth-place play-off match at the Parc des Princes. Meanwhile, France coach Bernard Laporte said that the defeat was tougher to take than England's 24-7 win in the 2003 semifinals. ""In 2003, they were better then us. In fact they were better than everyone,"" said Laporte, who is leaving his role to take up the post of junior sports minister in the French government. ""They were like the New Zealand of this tournament - the favorite, except they went all the way. This time it's harder because yesterday it was 50-50."" Meanwhile, England -- seeking to become the first nation to defend the World Cup title -- revealed that star kicker Jonny Wilkinson again had problems with the match balls during the semifinal. The fly-half, who voiced his concerns after struggling with the boot against Australia, rejected a ball before kicking a vital three-pointer against France. ""We didn't say it last week but a non-match ball got onto the field in Marseille which Jonny kicked,"" director of rugby Rob Andrew said. ""He didn't think about it while he was kicking it. ""The match balls are marked, numbered one to six. Last night they had 'World Cup semi-final England vs France' written on them. On match night, Jonny was vigilant when kicking for goal that they were actually match balls he was kicking. ""The practice balls lose pressure and shape. The whole issue last week, the organizers accepted all six match balls should be used by both sides on the Thursday before game.""",0
"Summary: Savers at leading UK mortgage bank lined up to empty their accounts. Northern Rock was bailed out by the Bank of England a day earlier. Reassurances that banks was safe have gone unheeded by many. Article: Savers at a leading UK mortgage bank lined up for a second day to empty their accounts Saturday, a day after the lender was bailed out by the Bank of England after heavily slashing profit forecasts. Fearful customers line up to withdraw cash from a Northern Rock branch in southeast London on Friday. Long lines formed before counters opened at the Northern Rock building society, one of the UK's top five lenders, as worried customers ignored reassurances from the bank and the government. Customers are believed to have already withdrawn about £1 billion ($2 billion) since the bank's woes were revealed, prompting speculation that the global credit crunch made raising funds through commercial borrowing difficult. Shares in Northern Rock dropped up to 30 percent in Friday trading, with problems spilling over the European banking sector. The British Bankers' Association has urged customers to ""calm down,"" according to the UK Press Association. It said: ""Northern Rock is a sound and safe bank and there is absolutely no reason for either mortgage customers or savers to worry."" Meanwhile, finance minister Alistair Darling said the Bank of England had stepped in ""to create a stable banking system"". He said: ""People can use their accounts in the usual way, they can carry on making their mortgage payments in the usual way. Northern Rock will be able to carry on its business."" Northern Rock chief executive Adam Applegarth said yesterday that the bank had yet to draw on the emergency cash, which he called ""a backdrop in case we need to use it"", according to PA.",0
"Summary: NFL chief, Atlanta Falcons owner critical of Michael Vick's conduct. NFL suspends Falcons quarterback indefinitely without pay. Vick admits funding dogfighting operation but says he did not gamble. Vick due in federal court Monday; future in NFL remains uncertain. Article: The National Football League has indefinitely suspended Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick without pay, officials with the league said Friday. NFL star Michael Vick is set to appear in court Monday. A judge will have the final say on a plea deal. Earlier, Vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in Virginia. ""Your admitted conduct was not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible. Your team, the NFL, and NFL fans have all been hurt by your actions,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a letter to Vick. Goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over. In papers filed Friday with a federal court in Virginia, Vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well. Falcons owner Arthur Blank said Vick's admissions describe actions that are ""incomprehensible and unacceptable."" The suspension makes ""a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the NFL will not be tolerated,"" he said in a statement. Watch what led to Vick's suspension ». Goodell said the Falcons could ""assert any claims or remedies"" to recover $22 million of Vick's signing bonus from the 10-year, $130 million contract he signed in 2004, according to The Associated Press. Vick said he would plead guilty to one count of ""Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture"" in a plea agreement filed at U.S. District Court in Richmond, Virginia. The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison, a $250,000 fine, ""full restitution, a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release,"" the plea deal said. Federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines. ""The defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense,"" the plea agreement said. In an additional summary of facts, signed by Vick and filed with the agreement, Vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs, but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won. ""Most of the 'Bad Newz Kennels' operations and gambling monies were provided by Vick,"" the official summary of facts said. Gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators Tony Taylor, Quanis Phillips and sometimes Purnell Peace, it continued. ""Vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights. Vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by 'Bad Newz Kennels.' "" Vick also agreed that ""collective efforts"" by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs. Around April, Vick, Peace and Phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at Vick's property in Virginia, the statement said. ""Peace, Phillips and Vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in 'testing' sessions at 1915 Moonlight Road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods, including hanging and drowning. ""Vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of Peace, Phillips and Vick,"" the summary said. Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia; and Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences. Vick, 27, is scheduled to appear Monday in court, where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge. See a timeline of the case against Vick ». The judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement. The federal case against Vick focused on the interstate conspiracy, but Vick's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges, according to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior,"" Toobin said Friday. ""The risk for Vick is, if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea, the state of Virginia could say, 'Hey, look, you admitted violating Virginia state law as well. We're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court.' "" In the plea deal, Vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary. Vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests. Vick agreed to ""make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated"" with the dogs that are being held by the government. ""Such costs may include, but are not limited to, all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case, including if necessary, the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals."" Prosecutors, with the support of animal rights activists, have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs. But the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against Vick and his admitted co-conspirators. Judge Henry E. Hudson issued an order Thursday telling the U.S. Marshals Service to ""arrest and seize the defendant property, and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property."" Both the judge's order and Vick's filing refer to ""approximately"" 53 pit bull dogs. After Vick's indictment last month, Goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the Falcons training camp, and the league is reviewing the case. Blank told the NFL Network on Monday he could not speculate on Vick's future as a Falcon, at least not until he had seen ""a statement of facts"" in the case. CNN's Mike Phelan contributed to this report.",0

"Prompt: Humans are the only intelligent species in the universe to have evolved from predators. Every other sentient species has evolved from a prey species ... and so they are terrified of us. Now it 's up to you to persuade the Galactic Council that we wo n't hunt them down and eat them all. Story: ""Your fear of my species is based on ignorance."" Angry shouting, bellows, shrieks, and many other manners of agitated vocalizations erupted from the outer walls of the chamber. One of the ambassadors attempted to throw a shoe at the *Homo Sapien* dignitary and was quickly hauled away from his balcony. Ambassador Milweather casually shifted his head as it careened past. He looked up at the Council balcony, ignoring the outbursts of the lesser races. Milweather honestly couldn't give a damn less what most of these backwater species thought of humanity. In the grand scheme of things, if push came to shove, the Sol system's full naval force could probably dwarf the combined forces of at least half of the overall races present in the chamber, and that was only considering the naval force of the Sol system alone. Some race of cow-faced manure farmers from some ugly little planet nobody could pronounce the name of believing that Humans were the living embodiment of one of their ancient deities of Death and Debauchery was of little consequence. The only ones that mattered sat right there in front of him, and the three of them remained stoic and stone-faced, including the Ji'dradi Ambassador, who literally appeared to be made of living cobble. The Ji'dradi ambassador waved one large, club-like hand at a bailiff, who then raised an object that looked somewhat like a large tuning fork which put out a sound that reminded Milweather of nails on a chalkboard. Apparently, this noise was universally detested by all races. It wasn't simply ear-piercing, but went deeper, screeching throughout Milweather's chest cavity, allowing even species that lacked ears to feel a sense of discomfort as it went on. The chamber became quiet save for the reverberating screech from the bailiff's tuning fork, and the ambassador lowered his hand again. With eyes resembling hot coals, the great stone man regarded Ambassador Milweather, and then in a deep, rumbling baritone, he said simply, ""**Explain yourself. **"" Milweather allowed himself a playful little smile, and threw his arms wide to the chamber surrounding him. ""You,"" he began, ""all of you see us as.... *monsters. *"" He gave a quick glance across the vast wall of balconies housing dignitaries from hundreds of other species. ""Yes? I'm right, aren't I?"" Snorts, murmurs, soft cooing and more filled the chamber as many nodded their heads in agreement. ""Why is that?"" Asked Milweather. ""Is it because we.... *can* eat meat? Because our bodies are built to allow us to subsist off the flesh of other species?"" ""*YOU ARE DISGUSTING HERETICAL BEASTS! *"" Shouted one dignitary, who was quickly silenced by a muting shield shooting up in front of his balcony, though others around him made sounds of agreement. ""Ahh, but therein lies the flaw with your views."" Said Milweather, focusing his attention back on the High Council. ""My operating word is *can*; we *can* eat meat. We can also eat plant-based material, such as fruit and vegetables. We are *omnivores*, not carnivores."" The Konluss Ambassador; a short, squat creature somewhat resembling a snail with arms, spoke up, ""The fact that you *choose* to eat meat makes it all the more unsettling."" The Konluss, despite their diminutive size and appearance, were one of the oldest and most well-respected races in the galaxy. Their strike forces were feared in ground-combat due to their shells being made of the same mineral composition of raw diamond, and in spite of their snail-like appearance, the agile Konluss move more like serpents. It was no wonder that they had been one of the first races to join among the High Council. ""Ambassador, allow me to ask you something."" Milweather said, turning his attention to the Konluss dignitary. ""Your people are very well respected among the other races as being both tough and well-organized."" The ambassador shifted his pudgy body and seemed to sit up a bit taller, ""That we are."" ""I have heard your people attribute your success to your devout worship of your Gods?"" ""Yes, that is correct,"" the ambassador answered, ""a true *Konluss'i* offers their life to our Lords, and their bodies to our collective."" He twirled one of his small, whisker-like appendages thoughtfully, ""A strong, singular belief is a strong basis for a well-organized government."" ""I would certainly agree,"" Milweather said with a smile, ""these practices and beliefs have shaped your society and culture for near-countless generations."" ""*If I may interject? *"" One of the others raised a cloven hand, ""*You stated you had something you wished to ask Ambassador St'roik*."" This was the Ambassador for the Imsith, a race of what Milweather could only describe as ""deer people."" Save for the fact they were bipedal, and their muzzles were closer to their faces, the Imsith merely resembled deer or elk. ""Yes, I was getting to that."" Milweather said coolly, not letting his annoyance show. ""Ambassador St'roik,"" he turned to the Konluss once more, ""once every lunar cycle on your home planet, your people celebrate a religious holiday called.... *Mogg'ruh*, am I pronouncing that right?"" ""Yes, that is correct,"" gurgled the snail. ""Would you mind filling me in a bit more on the festivities of this holiday?"" Milweather couldn't be sure, but he thought he could see a glint of elation in the slimy orbs at the end of the ambassador's eye-stalks. ""Absolutely. On Mogg'ruh, my people celebrate a full day of equal parts jubilation and prayer to our Gods for allowing the *Konluss'i* another glorious year of progress and prosperity."" The Ambassador beamed, and then quickly added, ""It's a tradition that's been around as long as our recorded history."" ""I see..."" Said Milweather, leaning back a bit on his heels, a small smile on his face. ""Ambassador, the name *Mogg'ruh* translates loosely to'Day of Purity' in the Galactic Universal Dialect."" Milweather had to contain himself from chuckling as he saw the Konluss deflate like a balloon. He knew where this was going. ""Now, I'm sure I am not the only one here today who was not aware of the *meaning* behind such a name."" Milweather continued, and began to slowly pace across his platform. ""Initially, the'Day of Purity' was a celebration of purifying the gene pool, by violently butchering the lowest members of your caste system in the streets."" ""That..."" The ambassador managed, ""That was a very long time ago."" ""Oh, how very long ago would that be?"" Milweather's eyes squinted and he scratched his chin, displaying a look of confusion. ""According to my most recent reports, many of your colonies-including your Capital System where your home planet resides-still holds ritualistic sacrifices during Mogg'ruh of the weak or the infirm. Of course, nothing like the mass slaughter that it used to be, but.... well, even if the children are the bastards of politicians, or the women might be promiscuous, I'm not sure I agree with *burning them alive* while you pray for a brighter future for your people."" The sounds of disgust and anger that were scattered among the many races made it hard for the Human Ambassador not to laugh. The Konluss, meanwhile, looked as if he wished to crawl into his shell. ""You besmirch the name of my people, sir!"" He protested, his whiskers twisting rapidly in agitation. ""Not at all,"" said Milweather, putting on a face of total innocence, ""I am simply stating what I've heard. My point being that while *some* of your kind may take part in actions that others may find deplorable, it isn't as though it directly effects *them*, nor does their disdain mean you must change what, for your people, was an important part of shaping their entire culture. If I had met you, and immediately told you that Mogg'ruh must never be celebrated again-"" ""Nonsense! Mogg'ruh is who we are! It is an important part of all *Konluss'i*, and those sacrificed are offered to the Gods to ensure the rest of us will continue to survive and thrive!"" ""*Survive.... *"" Mused Milweather, ""That's a good choice of words.... *survive and thrive. *"" He began pacing again, and turned his attention to the Imsith Ambassador; Tonriss Travels Snowy Valleys. The Imsith had such strange names. ""Ambassador Tonriss,"" he began, and the Imsith Ambassador's back straightened. ""*I will have you know right now, *"" she warned, ""*I will not stand for you painting my people's beliefs in a negative light. *"" contd.",0

"Summary: Nemanja Vidic plays in Man United's Champions League tie at Dynamo Kiev. Serbian defender sat out 4-1 win at Aston Villa with after-effects of concussion. United started group campaign with wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma. Article: Serbian central defender Nemanja Vidic has convinced Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson that he should play in Tuesday's Champions League clash away to Dynamo Kiev. Vidic clashes with Roma goalkeeper Gianluca Curci during the UEFA Champions League Group F match. The former Spartak Moscow player sat out Saturday's 4-1 victory at Aston Villa after suffering concussion during the Premier League win over Wigan immediately before the international break. However, he has made a good recovery and will now partner Rio Ferdinand in the heart of the United defense. Injury-plagued French striker Louis Saha definitely misses the tie with a long-term knee problem and fellow casualties Gary Neville and Owen Hargreaves also stayed behind. England striker Wayne Rooney, who scored twice against Villa and was also on target in England's Euro 2008 defeat against Russia in Moscow last week, will partner Carlos Tevez in attack. A third successive victory after 1-0 wins against Sporting Lisbon and Roma would virtually guarantee United a place in the knock-out stage. United flew to Kiev a day earlier than normal, taking their own chefs and dieticians with them. ""The travel is always the biggest worry in these situations,"" said Ferguson. ""Ukraine is further away than most other journeys around Europe."" Senegal defender Pape Diakhate, Guinea forward Ismael Bangoura and Ukraine midfielder Taras Mykhalyk are expected to return for Dynamo, but former Tottenham forward Serhiy Rebrov is an absentee. Dynamo warmed up for Tuesday night with a 1-0 win over strugglers Zakarpattia on Saturday in the Ukrainian Championship. But Kiev are bottom of Group F after losing their first two games -- 2-0 at Roma and 2-1 at home to Sporting. Glasgow Rangers are without Jean-Claude Darcheville and Brahim Hemdani for their formidable home clash against Barcelona on Tuesday. Darcheville is still struggling with a hamstring problem while Hemdani misses the Group E tie in Glasgow with a groin problem that kept him out of the weekend's 3-0 win against Celtic. UEFA Cup favorites Bayern Munich will probably have to do without midfielder Franck Ribery for their group game against Red Star Belgrade on Thursday.

"Question: Can PRISM predict length of PICU stay?

This being true, the inverse of the correlation between PRISM (or PRISM based LOS estimate) and LOS might be a candidate indicator of quality of care.",0

"Summary: Because of troubles, Lindsay Lohan likely difficult to insure. Lohan supposed to appear in Shirley MacLaine film ""Poor Things"" Insurance rates may cost 1 to 3 percent of film's production budget. Article: ""To insure or not to insure?"" It isn't Shakespeare, but it is the dramatic question Hollywood filmmakers are asking about Lindsay Lohan following her legal troubles this week. Lindsay Lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled, but the cost will be high. It is an important question, too, because whether companies insure Lohan's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off Hollywood's A-list. But Lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable, say underwriting experts. While some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars, experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison, even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost. ""For a price, anything can be done, although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just won't be interested,"" said Ross Miller, partner with insurance brokerage D.R. Reiff & Associates Inc. Lohan's arrest this week in Los Angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left Hollywood wondering if the actress, who shot to fame as a child in Disney films like ""The Parent Trap,"" is too risky to cast in a film. Timeline: Lindsay Lohan's troubles ». It remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in ""Poor Things,"" a film produced by and starring Oscar-winner Shirley MacLaine. See a gallery of Lohan's films ». A statement was expected early next week on whether the movie, already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by Lohan, will proceed with or without her. Insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations, although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of Lohan and fellow troubled party girls Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. ""I don't think it (a problematic artist) is any more of an issue,"" said Wendy Diaz, entertainment underwriting director at Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the leading film underwriter. ""It's pretty standard year to year."" But Diaz did say the terms for covering Lohan would likely be ""serious at this point."" She said Fireman's Fund, in such a case, would likely put in higher deductibles, or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted. Last July, a producer on Lohan's last film, ""Georgia Rule,"" scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set, costing the movie's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Brian Kingman, a managing director with entertainment insurance broker Aon/Albert G. Ruben said covering situations like Lohan's required a lot of calculation and risk management. Insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie's production budget, which can range from $5 million to $100 million or more, he said. ""Filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk,"" Kingman said. He said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance. In certain circumstances, drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples. In cases of known drug abuse, ""minders"" are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor. Kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration. ""I have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules,"" he said, citing the case of Robert Downey Jr., another high-profile star with a history of legal, drug and alcohol problems.",0
"Summary: Gloss taking backseat to bold colors in lipsticks. Exfoliate lips before applying a bold hue. Melissa Silver: ""Anyone can wear plum or sheer red"" at night. AJ Crimson likes subtle pink or sheer beige for all skin tones for day. Article: After years in the bronze age, when sun-kissed cheeks and gloss reigned supreme, fall's return to glamour means that lipstick is making a major comeback. Lipstick outsold gloss by $76 million last year, and beauty companies are racing to launch new formulas that are more wearable than ever. So pucker up. We'll show you how to apply lipstick perfectly, along with the most flattering shades for day and night. For foolproof application, stick with sheer, subdued shades in the morning and save deep, bold colors (which require more time and precision) for night. Daytime equation. 1. Condition and protect with a balm that contains sunscreen, like Softlips Raspberry with Green Tea SPF 20. ""Dab some on immediately after getting out of the shower, when your lips are still a little moist,"" suggests Hollywood pro Kara Yoshimoto Bua. The smoother your lips, the more perfect your lipstick will look. 2. Choose a soft shade such as rose or nude that you can apply straight from the tube. A hydrating formula ensures a smooth coat of color. Try Neutrogena Moistureshine Soothing Lipsheers in Fresh Rose. 3. Blot, reapply and blot again to remove excess oils and create a stain, says Bua. ""The color looks more natural and lasts longer."" Instead of tissues, use lint-free blotting papers, like Boscia Fresh Blotting Linens ($10). Nighttime equation. 1. Exfoliate before applying a bold hue like red or burgundy. Sally Hansen Gentle Peel for Rough Lips ($10; at drugstores) uses fruit enzymes to remove dry patches. 2. Create a base with a gel-based primer that fills in fine lines around the mouth and helps lipstick go on more smoothly. One to try: Olay Regenerist lip treatment ($19; at drugstores). 3. Define the borders of your mouth with a pencil to prevent color from bleeding, says Robin Fredriksz, who gave Barrymore her deep fuchsia lip. To avoid an unnaturally dark outline, use a shade that's lighter than your lipstick, like Revlon Colorstay lip liner in Plum ($8; at drugstores). 4. Brush on color for more control.

"Prompt: In 2050 the Rapture happens and the Apocalypse ravages earth. The colonies on the Moon and Mars are untouched by the events. Story: Hal sat in his office, watching a live feed of the rapture for the third day straight. He had seen the ascension of those saved. He had watched as the Damned crawled up through the ground and dragged the rest to hell. Now the whole planet was devoid of humanity. The door to his office slid open. Hal's secretary, Patti walked in. Her expression made him feel assured she shared a similar ambivalence about the situation. They watched shots of empty cities, streets, inter spliced with horrific showing yesterdays battle with the Damned. After several minutes Hal spoke ""I can't believe it. We are not affected."" ""I know, sir. I think we escaped it. I don't know which way I would go, but somehow it is an enormous relief to know I will forever be safe from that judgement."" The pair sat in silent for several more minutes. Both calmly processed the information for the first time since the rapture began. Hal started to sob. ""What? Family down there?"" Patti asked. ""No my whole ancestry immigrated generations back."" Hal replied with a sniffle. ""What then?"" ""What the fuck does this mean! Religion has been dead to me for so long. It just seemed silly in light of everything humanity has accomplished in the past few decades. Patti, I watched the Four Horseman descend from the fucking sky and decimate humanity. What does this mean for us? Are we out of the fucking dogma? Do we just go to sleep when we die? What?"" Patti had been contemplating that same thing. ""The way I see it there are two possibilities."" Hal stared at her intently. She continued. ""The first would be what you just said. We are exempt here on Mars. We go to sleep that's it."" Hal nodded anxiously. She continued. ""The second would be that we are now in the domain of another deity."" Patti walked by behind Hal and began massaging his shoulders. He relaxed in her grip. ""We may now be under the thumb of an incredibly benevolent and merciful God. One who loves our troubled race without reservation, and delivers us all to paradise when our time comes."" Hal hummed a peaceful affirmation. Patti drew a twisted and evil looking dagger from within her jacket. She continued. ""But that is not Mars, Hal. You were not so fortunate."" Something in her voice had changed. Something that made Hal stiffen, but paralyzed him. He could not move although mortal panic now gripped him. ""Our new God is old, Hal. Old and angry. We disgust him. And there is no hope of redemption. No martyr for our sins. Hell is paradise compared to his home. Our home. It's time for you to see."" Hal tried to speak but all he could manage was a soft whimper. Patti jammed the blade into the side of Hal's neck. Then quickly began sawing through his throat. ""Bless me lord of the Red planet!"" Patti shouted to the room, Hal's blood spurting all over her face. It coated her. Her heart glowed with the fiery ecstasy of his approval. It was time for humanity to know of Him and His wishes.",0
"Prompt: You are abducted by aliens. After some time aboard their ship, you manage to deduce that they 've abducted the wrong guy, and are desperately trying to keep their higher ups from finding out about their mistake. Story: oh shit oh shit oh shit they've taken me by the ears and I don't know what's going to happen next before they open the door to my cell to bring me to the master plan where they will say hey get back in there and don't try to escape from the bullets that we could put into your head at any minute I just want to be back in my bed on earth why did you have to bring me up here to see your master I'm just a young man that wants to be free of all the things that are chasing me through the endlessly cornered chamber wehere im being held against my will hellishly cold and trembling and pounding at the door to just please let me the fuck out of here and then they realized that the door to the next room was open and after shutting it they looked at one another deeply and told me that they were aliens who were just doing their jobs before the time was up and they had to go home and I said that's where I wanted to go but I don't think they believed me because when I laughed they cried and we all rolled around on the floor clutching our sides in the pale light from the ceiling fan in the cell next to the one with the open door that seems so much more appealing from over here but that I won't get to see because I need to go to their master to be evaluated for the new proposal to test the science study that they are currently performing and when I tell them that I don't have a problem with their luck they realize suddenly that they've made a grave mistake but since they are on the verge of getting fired out of the plank cannon I realize that I am shit out of luck as well oh no what the hell can I do to get free from here and they stare me down into the back corner where I cower in fear what will we do what will we do with this wrongfully abducted specimen that will be sure to muck up the results of our special science lab I dont know man I just dont know how we are going to get through this to the next room over there with the open door so relax I say and they listen to me for a second I have a plan to get me out of here and save your skins from the master plan for the worst but expect the best and they smile at me and then slowly at one another and I think they may be on my team and then pow I get a punch in the gut and there are kicks to my face and red starts at the edges of my eyes and then black and then I'm in the next room and the door is open and my captors are nowhere to be found but I hear what must be the master on the overhead radio exclaiming that he has cut the cuticle when trimming his nails and he needs the science experiment to be completed so the new technology can get rolled out to improve the technology of the current toe clipping material science matters at hand to hand combat as im running down the hall to the escape pod and the two little bastards that pulled me out of my bed in the night are close behind one another and then around the corner and then another and im running at top speed when I run into a door and its the first cell so I must have run in a circle or a square or some sort of closed polygonal shape shifting aliens reveal their true form and it's horrifying how much they look like my dead great aunt betsy whose picture hangs over the mantel in my dining room back home on what must be earth unless they are in my head and playing mind tricks but no this has to be real because I can feel the blood pulsing in my veins faster than anything ive ever felt before stop right where you are drop to the ground hey im the one giving orders here but yeah im gon na be the one to deliver this guy to master so I can get all of the extra credit on the test and I duck to the side as they begin firing lasers at one another first up and then to the down below the dining hatch compartment where the master is dining on his fresh toenail clippings according to the blaring voices on the loudspeaker that are intermittently interrupted by the sound of classical music from a classic walkman and the fizzle of laser canons in a hierarchical combat to establish who gets that extra extra special credit for the bungled abduction mission by my two captors because only one of them is going to get that promotion and then a hole opens up in the side of the bay door chamber still smoking from the discharged laser beam and I know its my chance and I jump out into space and the two of them they charge after me stop it please help me cries the master but soon his voice won't carry in the vacuum of space and where the fuck am I because earth is just a tiny blue speck in the distance and the bodies of the aliens floating slowly towards me trying to fire their lasers but getting sent in opposite directions spiraling this way and that according to some weird law of physics that they just refuse to obey like their master or maybe it's just that they are lazy or incompetent but I will never know because their flesh starts to expand in space rapidly and then blood is shooting out in quick little spurts first from the orifices of which there are many and then from every little which way into the stars and comets and obscuring that blue speck that might have been earth and so now hopelessly resigned to the situation where I am finding myself at this present hour away from everything I know and understand like the back of my hand so I begin to look down at my own quivering body that is about to tear at the seams between spacetime irrationaliy and reality tv stars pop red black",0
"Summary: Several famous songs written by men for a woman. Beethoven's ""Für Elise"" may have been written ""for Therese"" Songwriters make up stories about who is behind ""867-5309/Jenny"" Article: 1. ""Für Elise"" Bob Dylan wrote ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" for Joan Baez. Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven. Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled ""Bagatelle in A minor"" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written ""for Therese,"" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. ""Philadelphia Freedom"" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin. Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered ""amateurs"" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. ""Lola"" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies. Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, ""Lola"" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then ""Lola"" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side."" (""Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'."") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says ""Lola"" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. ""867-5309/Jenny"" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call. Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. ""Oh, Carol"" Written by: Neil Sedaka. Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with ""Oh, Carol,"" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of ""Oh, Carol"" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled ""Oh, Neil."" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. ""Oh, Neil"" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""The Loco-Motion."" 6. ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" Written by: Bob Dylan. Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. ""Our House"" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. ""Our House"" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally ""lit a fire,"" while Mitchell ""placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day."" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it.",0

"Summary: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa steers Bahrain's economic growth. Says Bahrain's strength is its ""human capital"" in the finance sector. Calls on world to unite to resolve nuclear dispute with Iran. Article: This week MME speaks to the man charged with boosting growth in the Kingdom of Bahrain: Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa. Sheikh Mohammed is concerned the nuclear dispute with Iran is deterring potential investors. As chief executive of the Economic Development Board, one of Sheikh Mohammed's main tasks is to ensure Bahrain stays ahead of its competitors. The government's pushing ahead with economic reforms to reduce the Kingdom's dependence on oil. But with crude prices near $100 a barrel, John Defterios asked whether the appetite for change had diminished. SM: The reforms are being done for aspirational reasons rather than necessity, so we are trying to enter the post-oil area because we want to. And therefore, because of this aspirational aspect, trying to get to as opposed to people pushing us somewhere we don't want to go. JD: How do you redefine Bahrain's role? Traditionally it's been a financial center, but you have Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Dubai even Abu Dhabi emerging in financial services. How you redefine it to sustain a lead? SM: The rising tide lifts a lot of places and as the region is booming and growing, financial services are growing throughout the region. Bahrain's strengths have been and will continue to be its human capital, the people that have led the financial sector and the long standing regulations that have been established in Bahrain. JD: Strategically and a geopolitical question here: the Crown Prince came out and declared what Iran's intentions really are -- in his view -- for a nuclear policy, and called for greater diplomacy right ahead of a visit by the President of Iran to the country. What's the motivation here? SM: We feel that the distraction caused by the Iranian nuclear issue is holding investment back in the region as a whole, and increasing the security threat of the region. Nobody is debating the right to peaceful nuclear power, but we all have that need and we all need a peaceful resolution to this. JD: Historically, Iran has even made claims against Bahrain, what do you do now moving forward now? Do you bring Russia, China, the United States and the European Union closer together, in terms of where we should be going in the future? SM: We've resolved our historical issue with Iran, and we are well beyond that, but going forward... This is such a important issue affecting security worldwide, that we feel it is important and at a level high enough that we need all powers involved because it does affect everybody. JD: Can the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) become much tighter as an organization to have a voice in that process; as opposed to speaking from the sidelines and hoping that the major powers move forward? SM: Absolutely, I mean, the GCC is speaking with a unified voice. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia came out with a proposal for providing nuclear fuel from an independent authority; this was completely backed from the GCC. We are all moving forward and are willing to play a beneficial role to resolve this issue. Meet the Sheikh:. Sheikh Mohammed bin Isa Al Khalifa is chief executive of the Economic Development Board, the organization responsible for stimulating and supporting growth of the Bahraini economy. He was appointed in June 2005, following 10 years working directly for His Highness Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, Commander-in-Chief of the Bahrain Defense Force and Chairman of the Economic Development Board. From 1995 to 1999, he was director of the Crown Prince's office. In 1999, he was appointed head of the court and also deputy head of the Crown Prince's International Scholarship Program. During this time, Sheikh Mohammed was heavily involved with the Crown Prince's initiatives to liberalize the telecommunications sector and with labor market and economic reforms. A keen motor sports enthusiast, Sheikh Mohammed was deputy board chairman of the Bahrain International Circuit and is a former vice president of the Bahrain Motor Club, now known as the Bahrain Motor Federation. Sheikh Mohammed, who is married with two sons and one daughter, was born on April 14, 1969. In 1992, he received a bachelor's degree in economic theory from the American University, Washington DC. Two years later, he received a post-graduate diploma in business studies from the London School of Economics. (source: Bahrain Economic Development Board)",0
"Prompt: Batman turns evil and starts committing crimes rather than stopping then. The Joker realises that in order to remain Batman 's antagonist he must turn good and become a hero. Story: Even the best of us have a dark side. And for Bruce, it was no different. Sure, his recent actions could be described as questionable at best. But who's to say he wasn't just up to his old tricks. Bruce sighed and continued down the alley. He was too old to care anymore, and it was time for payback, not too mention a decent paycheck. Just as he rounded the corner, that ugly grin peered out from the darkness. Dammit. He knew that grin from anywhere. “ What do you want, Joker? ” Batman seethed. “ I don't need your shit today and you know as well as I do that I don't have time for your games. ” “ What's wrong, Batboy? Have you finally decided it's time for a little fun? ” Joker cackled. Batman brushed by him, ignoring his comment, and continued on his path. “ You know you won't follow through, Batboy! ” Bruce heard Joker howl as he ducked into the swinging, cracked door. Joker knew better than to push Batman too far. Should Batman actually follow through with it, Joker would become an... ugh, he couldn't even say it. An accomplice. The instigator. The one who finally brought Batman to the dark side. He saw Batman before he heard the explosion, and already knew it was too late. Batman had done the unthinkable. He had killed for pleasure. “ This is just too much madness, even for me, ” Joker thought to himself. He had to put an end to it. Only the Joker could bring on chaos. NOT Batman.

"Prompt:Six months ago it was announced that a meteor would hit the earth and end all life. However it missed the earth after humanity had prepared for the end. Story: Just six months. That's all we really needed when our backs were against the wall, all we really needed for peace was our own imminent destruction. Kind of poetic, right? After millennia of war, nation against nation, creed against creed, mankind stood together at the last, all efforts failed, all possibilities tried together, all barriers broken down in those months of searching for a way to save us all. And then, it didn't come. Mankind stood together and watched the sky.... and nothing happened. When TV stations around the world spread the news that we were safe, that it was over, that it had missed us by a whisper, we stood, some stunned, some weeping, some screaming with joy. But in that six months, oh the things we learned! The things we discovered together, sharing information as fast as minds could think it up, the ideas we discarded one after another all had value, they all gave us new directions to explore. In the aftermath of world peace, no one wanted to break the spell, to be cut off from the technology we'd forged together, and so no one did. No one dared. No one wanted to be left behind. The end of the world that wasn't was the start of the newest age of technology, and the greatest time of peace. Together, we look to the stars.",0
"Prompt: You 're an immortal human who has been jumping from galaxy to galaxy looking for a way to die, but for the first time in 1.985 quadrillion years, you encounter something that makes you want to live. Story: The woman wandered through the ruins of a dead city. She had a number of names, words from languages so dead even their derivatives were dead, words in more contemporary tongues—or whistles, or *snects* depending on the physiology of the speaker—and words that may well have just been made up specifically to describe her. The children of humanity, the ones with civilizations that went far back enough to remember Earth, the *first* Earth, sometimes called her *Grandmother* or *Ancestress* or *Honored Progenitor* in varying translations. She had made no contact with them for some time, and as she picked up occasional relics of the dead civilization, then discarded them, she debated finding them again. She was sure she had never borne life from her body, but had long since given up disputing the matter. It would be good to see what they had made from themselves. Maybe they had found an answer to her question. Here, the people called her *Sapien* with no understanding of the word's origins, simply because she asked. She was the last of her species, and after her first few regenerations, she no longer remembered a proper name. It was the best she had. Of the major powers in her current galaxy, none looked like her anymore. These people, these primitives, had bred themselves to resemble her, to look almost like ancient humans, and she felt their loss more keenly than any she could still remember. After ancient humankind seeded the galaxy with colonies, they became less and less what Sapien considered “ human. ” Still people, but alien. They spread further, to other galaxies, other dimensions. Sapien had long since lost track. They adapted their new worlds to suit them. More often, they adapted themselves to suit their new worlds. Some changed through evolution, like the furred folk of a cold, mountainous planet. Some were self-modified, bearing virtually no similarity to the mankind of old. Earth itself was long gone, and so was New Earth, Terra Grande, and New New Earth. She couldn't keep track of it anymore. One of her first deaths was when she tried to die with Terra Grande. It was Earth all over again, with the sun-blasted remains of a scorched little rock gradually being absorbed into the corona. She remembered the pain of that death, her body immolated, the denial of oblivion, the unwelcome awakening. Dying by fire was the worst, an agony that persisted. Still, doing it that way lost her a hundred thousand years to the regeneration process, and then the agent of immortality woke her in the Ship, in some new place. It was time that passed quickly, rather than dragged slowly. Sapien thought her immortality as another person, as the *only* other person who could stay with her. Some imperceptible being who had been there all this time, who kept her from dying, who preserved her as a relic of the species that founded countless planets, that, so far, was the origin of at least half the life she found in the varying galaxies. It was long past time that she destroy this body and regenerate a new one, and yet she put it off. Age was not the issue, it was memory. These ruins, they carried so much of her hope with them, and had failed. The people she had raised here from primitives, through the fumbling first steps of civilization, to the cusp of the space age, only to fail and fall upon one another. It had been the work of ages, a hundred thousand years, a drop in her time bucket but still more intense than the previous million, more involved, more real to her than any of her pre-regeneration memories. She could obliterate herself for a time, and wake somewhere far away, and this emotional pain would be dulled by imperfect connections, by the inevitable forgetting, by time's erosion. But she remained, ignoring any of a number of opportunities. Her children, or as close as she could get to having children, had killed one another, and it seemed disrespectful to leave them without some sort of tribute, without understanding their fall. There had been some sort of closeness there. She wasn't their god, she wasn't their mother, she was their guide through the growing pains of civilization, and something had gone wrong. A generation or longer of wandering this planet, and she could find nothing to salvage, no one to save. Just the lesser life, the plants and animals that seemed familiar, but distinctly *off* in some indescribable way, just like the people here looked human, but for their slit nostrils, their jewel-bright hair colors, the pale spots that marked their spines and sides from armpit to hip. They were differences, but not imperfections. Quirks she valued, that helped her keep an emotional distance from them as individuals. She could still love, like she had loved these people. It was the cruelest pain she had ever known, even worse than dying by fire. After more years of wandering, Sapien found herself at the remains of the home she'd built for herself. Even here, she had managed to save no one, nothing except the ship, which really had probably saved itself. It stood on crumbling stone, too heavy for pavement, too massive for just one person, her silent partner in this endless life. It was time to move on. She had no answers. There were none to find. Like many times before, she would pilot the ship into a star or galaxy's core and end her suffering with unending pain, until her body regenerated. The Ship's systems gradually activated as she approached, the ramp lowering to greet her, lights glowing, as new as the day of her first trip, the one that had trapped her like this forever, the one that she still saw in nightmares every generation or so. That perpetually burnt-out light remained dark as she passed, it could be replaced but would *never* come on. The empty cargo bay, which was meant to carry supplies and usually carried nothing. The rows of empty stasis tubes that were supposed to be filled by others, in time, but had stood empty for the test flight, and so would always stand empty. Except, as she traced her hands along the familiar surfaces, some tubes were occupied. Six of them, three opposite her own pod, three beside it. Sleeping faces, slit nostrils, topped with vibrant hair. She looked back through the main pod hold, no others were occupied. That old curiosity stirred, wondering what had caused her to be trapped in this cycle of unending life, and now, what had caused these five to be trapped with her? She hated them instantly, raw envy clenching her fists. They wouldn't be alone when they woke, they would have one another through the endless ages. She loved them, just as quickly, because she wouldn't be alone when they woke. Their regeneration was incomplete; they must have died the first time at the end of their world. It would be decades before they woke. Decades were nothing. She could wait.",0
"Prompt:[ WP/MP ] Write a story reimagining a character from another piece of fiction as down-and-out/washed up/past their prime. Story: He sat in his new office, still amazed that it was finally his. He had fought his way tooth and nail up the corporate ladder, and now it was finally paying off. All the suit wearing, meeting attending, hand shaking, and ass-kissing had finally payed off. ""If only my teenage self could see me now,"" he thought. ""He'd hate me. But what did I know? I was a teenager."" He still remembered those awful boarding schools he had been shipped off to and subsequently kicked out of. He was such a rebel back then, getting in fights and skipping class, he didn't care about anyone but himself. No one except his sister that is. God, when was the last time they'd talked? Christmas? Had it really it really been that long? He'd been so focused on getting this promotion that he hadn't really thought about it. Perhaps he did still focus on himself too much. And he thought about himself then: his past self. The time he skipped school and ran off to New York. The times he'd go to watch the orchestra play with his parents, and the timpani player who was the only one there who seemed to be enjoying what he did. The worn orange hunting hat and bloodstained sweater that he refused to let go of that now sat in a box in his basement. And now here he sat, in a big office, at an important job. A phony. He had become a phony. He even had a name tag on his big phony desk, telling everyone who saw it that Holden Caulfield was a phony.",0

"Prompt: Rewrite your favorite knock-knock joke as a serious story. Story: The letter came on the November 2nd, it was in a nondescript white envelope, completely unwrinkled, her address printed neatly with robotic looking letters in sharp black ink. It seemed far too clean in general, there were no wrinkles or smudges, it was as if someone had shrink wrapped it. But of course Marie wasn't thinking that when she opened it. The thought crossed her mind briefly perhaps, but it wasn't until after she opened and read the letter did she begin to think frantically about its semantics.... if it matched the others in the news. ""Banana."" It said. Marie liked banana's actually, she read an article somewhere that most people don't get enough potassium. But in this context, the word scrawled in straight and cutting letters on equally clean and unwrinkled paper.... there were far more sinister undertones associated with it. Marie phoned the police, who informed her they would be dispatching a car to take her to the station so the letter could be analysed. To her dismay, after all the analysing was done it was positively matched to the others. The officers at the station told her not to worry, they would be dispatching a team to watch her 24/7, nothing would happen to her, she would be safe, they even went as far as to say that there was nothing to worry about, maybe no more letters would be sent. But that did little to ease Marie's shattered nerves, it did little to shift her from the gaze of the'banana killer'. Her house was watched by Bill and John both corporals with excellent records. She was interviewed on the news, had paid leave from work. It was quite nice actually. Then the second letter came. ""Banana"" it said, and Marie's world once again shattered to the ground and she couldn't stop looking over her shoulder. Then the third letter came, and she new it might only be a matter of time before she was dead, nobody had escaped the knife of the banana killer. He always killed after the third letter. ""It'll be OK."" ""He won't get passed us."" ""You've got nothing to worry about."" All these things were said, and after the third letter two extra officers were by her side, but it still did nothing to calm her. It was midnight. Marie was lying awake in bed, the street lights cast shadows through her window, every silhouetted lamp post and shrub projected onto her wall looked like a murderer poised to strike. Her heart pounded in here ears like the percussion section of an orchestra preparing for the final movement. Suddenly a shadow moved past the street lights and shrubs. Marie bolted upright, a scream welling in her stomach, her vocal chords milliseconds away from strumming into action. A leather gloved hand attached itself to her face, constricting itself over her mouth. ""Shhhh"" came a eerily soft voice, she could feel his hot breath around her ear. She felt a knife run against her throat. She was shaking, she couldn't think straight. But out of the convoluted stream of consciousness that her fight or flight response had kicked up, a single thought emerged. This is it. This is how it ends. Marie squeezed her eyes shut, tried not to think about how it would happen, how she would be gutted and cut up like all the other victims in the news. She tried desperately hard to transport her mind to a different place, but she couldn't, she couldn't help but focus on the knife pressed into her throat. Her heart was beating faster and faster, the drums pounding away, the orchestra about to reach the final climactic notes.... And then there was no knife on her throat, she looked around the room and couldn't spot anyone. A note fell out of her shaking hands, the calligraphic lettering all too familiar. Her hands continued to trembled as she opened it. ""Orange.""",0
"Summary: Fire Department spokesman: 14 have been taken to area hospitals. Firefighters still fighting hot spots Wednesday afternoon, official says. ""It's a hellish inferno,"" he tells reporters. Article: Four people were killed and several injured after an explosion Wednesday at a chemical plant sent a thick plume of smoke over a section of Jacksonville, authorities said. A thick plume of smoke rises Wednesday at a chemical plant in Jacksonville, Florida. ""Literally, it's a hellish inferno. There is no other way to describe it,"" said Fire Department spokesman Tom Francis. Fourteen people were hospitalized after the blast at the T2 Lab on Faye Road, in an industrial area on the waterfront in north Jacksonville, Francis said. Officials initially ordered an evacuation of nearby businesses, but by 4 p.m. the order had been lifted after tests of the air found no toxicity, Francis said. Firefighters were still battling hot spots, and the effort will be going on for ""quite some time,"" he said. See an I-Report account about the blast ». Six of those injured were transported to Shands Hospital in Jacksonville, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Brockmeier said. A Shands official said the hospital incident command system had been activated -- something done to put the staff in high alert in anticipation of trauma patients. A woman who answered the T2 Lab's 24-hour facility emergency phone said the plant manufactures ecotane, a gasoline additive that reduces tailpipe emissions, according to the laboratory's Web site. See a map of the site of the explosion ». The billowing black smoke could be seen from the city's downtown, said Florida Times-Union reporter Bridget Murphy. Murphy said she talked to several workers as they walked out of the area, and they were ""shaken to the core."" ""They described a hissing noise and then a sound wave,"" she said. Antonio Padrigan was trying to get in touch with his son, who works in a plant in the area, but was having no luck reaching him on his cell phone. ""He was shook up when he called me, but I can't get through to him anymore,"" Padrigan said. ""I don't know if he's in the hospital or what."" CNN I-Reporters Jonathan Payne and his son Calvin, 16, shot pictures of the explosion. They felt the blast shake their home, about 15 minutes away, and went to see what was going on. Carlton Higginbotham, 63, was working at home on Townsend Boulevard in Jacksonville when a loud boom shook his house, he said. ""It was a gunshot-type explosion; it wasn't a rumble,"" he said. Higginbotham, an insurance salesman, and his neighbor ran outside and noticed thick smoke billowing from the other side of the St. Johns River, which separates his neighborhood from the site of the blast. ""The cloud that came out of it was white, some would say mushroom-shaped,"" Higginbotham said. ""It was followed by dark, dark smoke.""",0
"Summary: State-run news agency: China orders an investigation by quality control agencies. Children who swallow the beads can become comatose or have seizures. Toys are sold as Aqua Dots in the U.S., as Bindeez Beads in Australia. Three children were hospitalized in Australia after swallowing large quantities. Article: China has suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful ""date rape"" drug, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. The toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness. China suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a ""date rape"" drug. The agency said that the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine (AQSIQ) has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available. The AQSIQ did not reveal the name of the toys' producer, Xinhua said. U.S. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the Chinese-made toys Wednesday. Scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that, once metabolized, converts into the toxic ""date rape"" drug GHB (gamma-hydroxy butyrate), Scott Wolfson, a spokesman with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), told CNN. ""Children who swallow the beads can become comatose, develop respiratory depression or have seizures,"" a CPSC statement warned. The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name ""Aqua Dots,"" have also been distributed in Australia under the name ""Bindeez Beads."" The Bindeez toys were recalled Tuesday by Melbourne-based Moose Enterprise Pty. Ltd. after three children in Australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized. ""I was so frightened because I thought she wasn't going to make it,"" Heather Lehane told CNN affiliate Network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter, Charlotte, who was hospitalized in Australia after ingesting some of the beads. In the United States, the Washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads, which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old ""swallowed several dozen beads. He became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time."" The commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since ""fully recovered."" The second incident involved a child who vomited, fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days. It was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery. Toronto-based toy distributor Spin Master Ltd. stopped shipping the Aqua Dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves, where they were previously sold for $17 to $30. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Wal-Mart on Thursday listed the toys on its Web site as ""out of stock online"" and had removed them from their top toy list as well. This latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of Chinese-made toys that have swept across the country. Last month alone, U.S. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 Chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint, which can cause hazardous lead poisoning. CNN's Janine Brady, Jason Carroll, Laura Dolan, Julie O'Neill and Leslie Wiggins contributed to this report.",0
"Question: Antral follicle assessment as a tool for predicting outcome in IVF--is it a better predictor than age and FSH? Answer: In vitro fertilization outcome is strongly correlated with both maternal ages, basal cycle, day 3 follicle, stimulated hormone, and antral follicle assessment. Antral follicle assessment was a better predictor of in vitro fertilization outcome than were age or follicle stimulated hormone.

"Summary: ""Inspiring Impressionism"" looks at Old Masters, other influences on modern art. Featured are works of Monet, Renoir, Cézanne, Cassatt, Morisot. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" runs through January 31, 2008, at the High Museum. Denver Art Museum and Seattle Art Museum get the show next. Article: It is an irony of contemporary art-museum management: Sometimes the museum that creates an exhibition doesn't get to premiere it. In a treatment of a Bridgeman Art Library photo, the High shows visitors Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery."" This is the case this week, as Atlanta's High Museum of Art couples its public opening of a second year of Louvre-fueled shows from Paris, France, with an exhibition about influences on the Impressionists. ""Inspiring Impressionism"" is organized by the Denver Art Museum. It opened Tuesday at the High, to run there through January 2008. With the backing of Northern Trust, the show will then travel to Denver February 23 to May 25, 2008, and then on to the Seattle Art Museum from June 19 to September 21, 2008. Why not start in Denver? That museum this fall is host to pieces seen in the first year of the three-year Louvre Atlanta series of exhibitions. Like priceless dominos falling, these shows roll around the country and the world, globalization dictating galas, super-sensitive custom shipping companies probably among the biggest winners. See a gallery of images from 'Inspiring Impressionism' at the High Museum of Art ». Another unintended effect may be shadowing of one important outing by another. It should be interesting to learn whether showing ""Inspiring Impressionism"" at the High on the same time frame as the second year of Louvre Atlanta pays off. Do all the boats in Monet's ""Autumn on the Seine, Argenteuil"" float? Smart museum-goers will see it all. ""The Louvre and the Ancient World"" and the companion show ""The Eye of Josephine,"" after all, look at some of the oldest treasures in the Louvre's vast holdings. See a gallery of some of the highlights of the Louvre Atlanta shows ». The fit is comfortable, in a way, the Impressionist movement of the turn of the last century finding its main proponents in French artists. The emphasis here, however, is on what older works may have moved and motivated such artists as Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne. One very distinctive connection from the Louvre Atlanta opener of last year is a section of this new show that looks at the tradition of modern-era artists learning by studying the work of masters at the Louvre, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo's ""The Beggar Boy"" of around 1650 being one of the most-copied canvases in Western art's modern history. From the outset, visitors to ""Inspiring Impressionism"" are reminded of the Louvre treasures all around them at the High: The Impressionism show's entry gallery is flanked by a handsome photographic treatment of Louis Jules Arnout's ""View of the Grand Gallery at the Louvre"" from between 1850 and 1870. In that original painting and color lithograph that followed, Arnout captured the bustle of artists working and visitors promenading in the Louvre's chief exhibition space that runs along the Seine in Paris. In fact, even older-era echoes of this same concept are encountered on looking at Louvre Atlanta's ""The Tiber"" marble from the first century A.D., you're reminded that Michelangelo himself was aware of that piece, influenced by it, presumably inspired by it. So a surprise symmetry takes shape at the High this fall, as visitors contemplate dialogues between museums (the Louvre, the High, Denver, Seattle), the viewers of art in Europe and the United States, and the artists themselves in France, in the U.S. and elsewhere. High director Michael Shapiro calls these synchronicities ""visual evidence of connections."" His colleagues Timothy Standring of Denver and Ann Dumas of London, England, have held up their end of this conversational eyeful with timely contributions, glimpses of Old World craft from Titian and Velasquez to Fragonard and Rubens -- and the ""moderns"" who saw beyond them to a new age of aesthetic debate. Don't miss some of the comments and writings of various artists, used as part of the display of the show at the High. Degas may have said it most honestly: ""No art is less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of refection and the study of the Old Masters."" Joining Northern trust Corporation in funding the exhibition are the National Endowment for the Humanities, and support is also provided by an indemnity from the Federal Council on the Arts and the Humanities.",0
"Summary: YouTube questions address taxes, the Bible, abortion, gun control. Giuliani, Romney, Huckabee spar over immigration. McCain challenges Paul over suggestion to bring troops home from Iraq. Nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate; 2,000 more than Democratic debate. Article: The acrimony from the Republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the CNN/YouTube GOP presidential debate Wednesday. The debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. With five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season, the Republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all, trying to differentiate their views on immigration, the Iraq war, abortion, gun control and even whether they believed every word in the Bible was true. Unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, Wednesday night's attacks were launched at each other. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney traded jabs over illegal immigration, something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month. Romney attacked Giuliani's record, saying that as mayor, he promoted illegal immigration. And Giuliani shot back, accusing Romney of having a ""sanctuary mansion"" at his own home. Watch the debate format produce raw moments ». ""In his case, there were six sanctuary cities. He did nothing about them. There was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home, illegal immigrants were being employed,"" Giuliani said. Romney denied Giuliani's allegation, and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other. In his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party, Romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has been rising in the polls. Rep. Tom Tancredo, who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration, seemed delighted with the give and take, saying the other candidates were trying to ""out-Tancredo"" him. Huckabee drew one of the night's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the Internal Revenue Service. ""Most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging, and there's a reason why,"" he said. Sen. John McCain, freshly back from a visit to Iraq over Thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates, and Rep. Ron Paul, the most anti-war of the candidates, tangled on two occasions over the Iraq war. Did YouTubers get their questions answered? ». Asked which government programs they would cut, Paul said bringing the troops home from Iraq would save ""a trillion dollars."" McCain said: ""It's that kind of isolationism that caused World War II,"" which drew some hoots from the crowd. Watch McCain, Paul spar on Iraq ». Paul replied: ""The real question you have to ask is why do I get the most money from active duty officers and military personnel?"" A retired brigadier general, Keith Kerr, who is gay, asked candidates if they thought U.S. military personnel were professional enough to work with gay and lesbian troops. CNN later learned that a June media release from the campaign of Democratic front-runner Clinton listed Kerr as a member of its steering committee for gay and lesbian supporters. Watch Kerr deny that the Clinton campaign influenced his question ». David Bohrman, CNN senior vice president and executive producer of the debate, said, ""We regret this incident. CNN would not have used the general's question had we known that he was connected to any presidential candidate."" Political Ticker. Kerr told CNN after the debate that he has not worked for the Clinton campaign and was representing no one other than himself. Kerr also said he is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a national gay and lesbian Republican grass-roots organization. Prior to the debate, CNN had verified Kerr's military background and that he had not contributed money to any presidential candidate. In a section of the debate about gun ownership rights, three of the GOP presidential hopefuls said they do not own guns: McCain, Giuliani and Romney. Former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson quipped, ""I own a couple of guns -- but I'm not going to tell you what they are or where they are."" Watch the candidates address gun control ». The debate turned personal when a viewer, holding the Bible, asked: ""Do you believe every word of this book? And I mean specifically, this book that I am holding in my hand."" Huckabee, a Baptist minister, said, ""Sure, I believe the Bible is exactly what it is."" Giuliani said he believes the Bible, but not ""literally true in every respect."" After that, Romney stammered a bit when moderator Anderson Cooper asked him if he believed every word. Watch the candidates get personal about the Bible ». ""Yeah, the Bible is the word of God. ... I might interpret the word differently than you interpret the word, but I read the Bible and I believe the Bible is the word of God,"" Romney said. When asked about abortion, Romney said he was wrong in favoring a woman's right to choose -- his position when he was elected governor of Massachusetts. ""If people in this country are looking for someone who's never made a mistake on a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, they're going to have to find somebody else. On abortion, I was wrong,"" he said. His remarks came in response to the 30-second video produced for the debate by Thompson's campaign, which included a clip of Romney expressing support for Roe vs. Wade during a 1994 debate against Sen. Ted Kennedy. When asked what women and doctors should be charged with if abortion was to become illegal, Paul said it was not an issue for the president or the federal government. ""We don't need a federal abortion police, that's the last thing we need,"" Paul said. He added that the issue should be left to the states and courts and not federal authorities. On the issues of taxes, Thompson said he'd ""never met a tax he liked."" ""I've got a tax-cut bill on the table. But I don't do pledges to anybody but the American people,"" he said. His response was met by a ""Go, Fred, go!"" from a member of the audience. On the issue of trade with China, Rep. Duncan Hunter said China is ""cheating on trade ... and it's in the interest of the United States to stop China's cheating. Buy American this Christmas season -- that might keep your neighbor from losing his job."" The candidates fielded video questions submitted by the public via the YouTube Web site, just as Democratic White House candidates did in July. The debate was the first time the GOP candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month. CNN's political team viewed nearly 5,000 videos for the GOP debate -- about 2,000 more than they saw for the Democrats' debate.",0

"Summary: President Musharraf orders troops to take a television station's equipment. Pakistani opposition leader Imran Khan says he's under house arrest. President Musharraf says his actions are for the good of the country. White House calls Musharraf's emergency declaration ""disappointing"" Article: Hours after declaring a state of emergency Saturday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf ordered troops to take a television station's equipment and put a popular opposition leader under house arrest. President Pervez Musharraf explains his actions in a televised address Saturday. Musharraf also suspended the constitution and dismissed the Pakistan Supreme Court's chief justice for the second time. On Sunday, police arrested the Javed Hashmi, the acting president of ex-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's opposition party was arrested, along with 10 aides, The Associated Press reported. Hashimi was arrested when he stepped outside his house in the central city of Multan, AP reported. The country is at a critical and dangerous juncture -- threatened by rising tensions and spreading terrorism, Musharraf said in a televised address to the nation after declaring martial law. As Pakistani police patrolled the streets of the capital, Islamabad, Musharraf said his actions were ""for the good of Pakistan."" Watch Musharraf's speech ». There was quick condemnation from within and outside his country. The Supreme Court declared the state of emergency illegal, claiming Musharraf -- who also is Pakistan's military chief -- had no power to suspend the constitution, Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry said. Shortly afterward, government troops came to Chaudhry's office and told him the president had dismissed him from his job. Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar was quickly appointed to replace him, according to state television. It was the second time Chaudhry was removed from his post. His ousting by Musharraf in March prompted massive protests, and he was later reinstated. See a timeline of upheaval in Pakistan ». Musharraf complained in his speech that the media -- which he made independent -- have not been supportive, but have reported ""negative"" news. Early Sunday, two dozen policemen raided the offices of AAJ-TV in Islamabad, saying they had orders to take the station's equipment. The government also issued a directive warning the media that any criticism of the president or prime minister would be punishable by three years in jail and a fine of up to $70,000, said Talat Hussain, director of news and current affairs for AAJ. Watch a former Pakistani P.M. call the developments in his country 'disturbing' ». U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice -- who is in Turkey for a conference with Iraq and neighboring nations -- said The United States doesn't support any extra-constitutional measures taken by Musharraf. ""The situation is just unfolding,"" Rice said. ""But anything that takes Pakistan off the democratic path, off the path of civilian rule is a step backward, and it's highly regrettable."" A senior Pakistani official said the emergency declaration will be ""short-lived,"" and will be followed by an interim government. Martial law is only a way to restore law and order, he said. Mahmud Ali Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, agreed. ""I can assure you, he will move on the part of democracy that is promised ... and you will see that happen shortly."" Musharraf was re-elected president in October, but the election is not yet legally official, because the Supreme Court is hearing constitutional challenges to Musharraf's eligibility filed by the opposition. Under the constitution, Musharraf couldn't run for another term while serving both as president and military leader. The court allowed the election to go ahead, however, saying it would decide the issue later. Some speculated that the declaration of emergency is tied to rumors the court was planning to rule against Musharraf. Musharraf has said repeatedly he will step down as military leader before the next term begins on November 15 and has promised to hold parliamentary elections by January 15. Meanwhile, popular opposition leader Imran Khan said early Sunday that police surrounded his house in Lahore, barged in and told him he was under house arrest. Musharraf also had Khan placed under house arrest during a government crackdown in March 2006. Asked about Musharraf's actions Saturday, Khan said, ""We are going to oppose this in every way."" ""None of us accept ... this whole drama about emergency."" Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto -- who arrived in Karachi Saturday from Dubai, where she had gone to visit her family -- described a ""wave of disappointment"" at Musharraf's actions. Watch crowds surround Bhutto upon her arrival ». Bhutto -- who returned to Pakistan last month after several years in exile -- wants to lift her Pakistan People's Party to victory in January's parliamentary election in the hope she can have a third term as prime minister. The nation's political atmosphere has been tense for months, with Pakistani leaders in August considering a state of emergency because of the growing security threats in the country's lawless tribal regions. But Musharraf, influenced in part by Rice, held off on the move. Watch a report on the volatile situation in Pakistan ».

"Prompt: You live in Skyrim. It is your job to keep lit all the candles in the abandoned caves and dungeons and castles. Story: Light is a marvelous thing. It alone can turn a dead and inhospitable cave and make it come alive, welcoming as a humble abode. Without it, even the most luxurious palace becomes cold and depressing. Baldin knew this well. The Old Kingdom was rich with forgotten knowledge and artifacts, hidden in old ruins and abandoned temples. But who would venture foolishly into darkness to try and pry this wealth of information without a guiding light? Baldin liked to keep to himself, watching people from afar. At night, a single candle can function like a beacon, drawing adventurers from all over the land, like moths to a flame. And Baldin wasn't gon na let a lack of light keep them from going. Adventurers love exploring, making their own path and discovering new things. But they don't see the invisible hand that led them there. Adventurers go where Baldin wants them to go. But even though the caves and ruins may be old and forgotten, they are not entirely deserted. Many traps await the unobservant explorer, and these are no good places to injured, especially considering that the dwellers one might stumble upon can be quite threatening. But for the courageous such tremendous awards awaits; Dwarven metals, Dremoran trinkets, Daedric armors and so much more. Skyrim have some mighty fine adventurers. And all this thanks to light. Once an adventurer has conquered one of these dungeons and heads back home, they follow the lights blindly, even if they have moved. Or they might go and find that the candles are no more. Baldin likes to play little tricks and have fun with his guests. Baldin has found that most of his guests can't go more than a few days without light. If they don't find their way out they often they go stark mad, resorting to bashing their skulls against rocks or throwing themselves of a cliff. Or they try to sleep. Leaving all that loot for Baldin. Light is a marvelous thing.",0

"Prompt: `` For what it 's worth ... I 've always loved you. '' Story: As the raindrops rolled down my face, mixing with the single, solitary tear I had been unable to contain, all I could think about was how it had come to this? My mind's eye stared back over the years we had known each other, two people brought together beyond all reason or chance, to create the most powerful combination of thoughts and feelings that either of us had experienced in our lives. We'd been such strong friends for so long, both forbidding ourselves from acting on the thought that if we were truly together, we could have something beyond beautiful. She was my angel, and I her rock. Right now that sweet summer where we finally took the leap of faith and admitted our love seemed so long ago. I looked in her eyes that once had been filled with such hope, but now in those hazel depths all I could see was sadness. ""Why? Why like this? Why couldn't we make it work?"" I shook my head, trying to find the words to fill the void that question left. ""Life is cruel. It's thrown us on to different paths. I wish this wasn't goodbye."" Her hand found mine, and squeezed tightly. ""I'm a better person because of you. I've struggled so long to accept who I am, but you were the one person who always accepted me, no matter what."" ""I've given you everything I am. From the moment I first saw you, in that forest, so many years ago, I was yours. For what it's worth.... I've always loved you."" She turned away slowly, and began to walk away for the final time. As she glanced back timidly, ours eyes met once more. ""It's worth everything, I'm so sorry that wasn't enough.""",0

""I will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated, that we are responding to the needs of people, but most importantly I want the people in Southern California to know that Americans all across this land care deeply about them,"" he said. The action follows an emergency declaration by Bush on Tuesday morning for the counties of Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura. He said he's ""looking forward"" to his visit to the region on Thursday. According to a statement from the White House, the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that ""can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster."" FEMA and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the Gulf Coast in 2005. For example, the fires aren't covering every square foot of the region, as Katrina did. The devastation in California is intense but not universal. During and immediately after Katrina, the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the U.S. Army -- could not get within miles of the disaster's epicenter, New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward, for several days. By contrast, roads in Southern California have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay. Residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape, whereas many of Katrina's victims were poor and had no means of transportation. Victims in California are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water, but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places. One of those safe places is San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium, which is not endangered by the fires. FEMA and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims' needs in an organized way. New Orleans' Superdome, on the other hand, sitting in the center of the disaster zone, was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water. What had been a shelter devolved into a trap. Katrina also wiped out the Gulf Coast's communications infrastructure, crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff acknowledged Tuesday that the government's response machinery had benefited from the Katrina experience. ""I think there's no question that [there were] a couple of the lessons from Katrina which we have put into effect here,"" Chertoff said. ""First of all, planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges, so that we have worked together and planned together with the Defense Department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis. That's been a big help here,"" Chertoff said. ""Second, we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue,"" Chertoff said. Chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have FEMA ready, ""and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent, and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent, we sprang into action yesterday. ""So we've been monitoring the situation continuously. The president's been on top of it. We've been on top of it. And we're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can."" Chertoff said Tuesday that he hadn't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance. ""We have been moving cots, blankets, other supplies into the area of San Diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity,"" he said. ""We've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire, once the winds begin to die down."" People left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov, Paulison said. Watch Paulison discuss the ""new FEMA"" ». He denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of Katrina that the federal response was hampered because National Guard equipment was in short supply because of the Iraq War. ""I just haven't seen that,"" he said. The U.S. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires, including 11 Defense Department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six C-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant. More than 17,000 National Guardsmen have been made available; 550 Marines were ready for deployment from Camp Pendleton, north of San Diego; and 12 Defense Department firefighting teams, were engaged.",0

"Summary: Taliban militants kill Australian commando in southern Afghanistan. He was shot during operation to clear Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan. This is the fourth Australian soldier to die in the conflict in Afghanistan. Several militants killed and a coalition troop injured in other fighting in southeast. Article: One Australian soldier, three civilians and Taliban militants were killed early Friday during heavy fighting in southern Afghanistan, according to information from Australian and NATO officials. Four Australian troops have now died in the conflict in Afghanistan. The incident occurred in Tarin Kowt in Uruzgan province, where Taliban militants killed an Australian commando, the Australian Defence Ministry said. The 26-year-old commando -- Pvt. Luke Worsley of Sydney -- served with the Special Operations Task Group. This is the fourth Australian troop to die in the Afghan conflict. ""The action in which Private Worsley died only concluded in the last few hours and was characterized by heavy, close quarter fighting. The SOTG was conducting an operation to clear an identified Taliban bomb making facility in Uruzgan province, when the soldier was hit by small arms fire,"" Chief of the Defence Force Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said ""a significant number of Taliban insurgents were killed or captured as part of the operation. Taliban insurgents initiated the firefight which lasted several hours."" Gen. Carlos Branco, ISAF spokesman, said it is not known how the civilians, two women and a child, died. ""However, we do know that the insurgents fired upon ISAF soldiers from the compound in which the Afghan civilians (two women and one child) were found after the fight. ISAF makes all effort to prevent losses of innocent civilian lives.""",0
"Prompt: In 2006 NASA quietly removed `` to understand and protect our home planet '' from it 's mission statement. A scientist at NASA is about to find the terrible truth why. Story: My shoes clicked upon the tile, emanating slight squeaks as they lifted again. The pit of nerves in my stomach continued to grow and I adjusted my tie, hoping it would make me feel more confident. The lights in this sub-basement were dim, and as I approached the door at the end of the hall, my shadow was strongly cast over the handle. I stopped for a moment, assuring myself this is what I wanted. Shoulders back in faux confidence I opened the door to hopefully find out what I had been looking for. The room was a mess of monitors, cables and the smell of too many men going without showers. A large screen at the far end bore a visual of earth, superimposed with data that I had no understanding of. One man stood up, wiping his palms on his lab coat as he approached me, a nervous smile flitting across his face. “ Terrance? Hi I'm Noah, good to have you on board. They didn't give you any information on this project before they sent you down here did they? ” In a reflexive manner, he anxiously glanced over his shoulder at the large screen, turning back to me with a momentarily more relaxed face. “ No, but I've heard that this division is the reason NASA removed the'to understand and protect our home planet'clause from the mission statement. It's been something that bothered me all the way through my geological doctorate. What caused us to stop wanting to explore that? ” Noah glanced over his shoulder again. “ Heh, well… semantics really. I guess they didn't want anyone to think there was any other course of action when it happens. ” He motioned to a chair near me, “ you should really sit down. Most people want to sit down when they first hear the truth. ” Waiting with something resembling more a grimace than a smile he motioned again. I settled in, fighting to keep my confident pose I had entered with. “ I'm just going to come out and say it. ” Noah seemed to be speaking more to himself than me as he grabbed a wireless keyboard, carefully aiming at the screen as he entered a few rapid keystrokes. The image of the earth became cross sectioned, and what I saw didn't register until Noah spoke again. “ The earth is… pregnant. ” I looked at his serious and dour face, then back to the image of something curled up in the inner core of the earth. “ Are you fucking with me Noah? ” I stood up, annoyed that they would try to pull such a ridiculous prank on someone who was new to the team. “ I, heh, really wish that I was. We don't know what it is, no probe has been able to get close enough to get any accurate readings on it. But we can use the earth as a sort of abdomen and get a basic ultrasound. It is alive, and.... it has been growing. ” I sank back into the chair, all confidence leaving my body. “ So what? They took out the clause so people wouldn't get upset when we attacked it without understanding what it is? You think they would understand survival on that level. ” Noah shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly as he brought up more data on the screen. I read it without comment, understanding some, not grasping a majority. “ People can get… petty and divisive over inconsequential things. I mean, just look at the last election. Heh. ” A light, accompanied by a buzzer, went off in one corner, cutting Noah's bad attempt at a joke off. “ You getting this Noah? ” Another person in the room popped their head up from their cubicle, calling to our direction. “ Yeah, yeah. ” He responded quickly, moving to a desk, summoning data to the screen. “ I guess this is scenario delta then! ” “ I'm sorry, what? ” I followed him over, feeling completely out of my league. He shrugged in a defeated way and didn't look at me as he delivered a single word that shook me to my core. “ Labour.""",0
"Question: Can we measure mesopic pupil size with the cobalt blue light slit-lamp biomicroscopy method? Answer: Although the SLBM is quite repeatable, it underestimates mesopic pupil size and shows a too wide range of agreement with CIP. SLBM shows low sensitivity in detecting pupils larger than 6 mm, which may be misleading when planning anterior segment surgery. Previous grading-consensus training strategies may increase interrater reproducibility, and compensation for the systematic underestimation could improve accuracy of the SLBM.",0
"Prompt: There was an angel caught in the power lines. Story: It was my first day on the job, and the first time I ever smelled burning angel wings. I was shadowing Mike Fenwick, an old hand at wildlife and pest control and one of the best in the business. After twenty years working municipal, he'd gone independent with his own company, Fenwick Animal Control, and soon scored a corporate contract to supply animal control services to General Electric. His job was to patrol their southern Illinois facilities looking for evidence of vermin and pests, respond to calls regarding nuisance animals, set traps and remove captured animals, that sort of thing. Business was good, and he'd taken on several technicians to help him manage an expanding workload. I was the latest. I was fresh out of a Wildlife Biology degree, and expecting to spend my days wrangling possums, raccoons, mice and the like. The one thing I hadn't expected to be wrangling was angels, but we got the call at 11:20am, an angel trapped in the power-lines south of Pittsburg, and Mike set me straight on the way over there. ""Most sixty percent of our work right now is angels,"" he told me. ""Clients like to keep it on the down low, so you don't hear about it so much. Not good PR to have pictures of an angel getting cooked in your UHV line on the the six o'clock news, or smeared on the grille of one of your fleet trucks. But it's a real problem, for them anyway. For us it's gravy."" ""But where do they come from?"" ""There's a big nest down Shawnee way, somewhere in the national forest they reckon but they haven't figured out where. Sometimes you get whole flocks of them coming out at once. Quite a sight if you get to see it."" ""Yeah, but where do they *come* from,"" I said. ""Do you know? Everyone tells a different story."" ""Well,"" Mike said, ""All I can say is I know a story too. Can't say it's for true for sure, but I've discussed the matter with some important folks over the years, and they've said the same thing."" ""What's the story?"" ""Well, just a moment, we're here."" Here was a spot a indistinguishable from any other in the endless, flat landscape of cornfields through which we'd driven. Only Mike's GPS could tell us we were in the right spot. The power-lines were a ways off from the highway, so we'd have to walk a bit. ""I hope it did't get stuck up there,"" said Mike, ""I don't fancy doing live-line work."" He grabbed a large bag of gear from the back of the truck, which he then handed to me, and we started walking. ""The story I heard,"" I said, after a minute or two, ""is that it was some evangelical pastor, who was also a genetics genius. Thought he'd create his own army of angels to help bring God's kingdom to Earth."" Mike just let out a chuckle at that. ""Kid, I met a few pastors in my time, and not one of them was a genius in any sort of science. No, that story's mostly horseshit, I'm afraid. There's a grain of truth to it, but just a grain."" By then we'd reached the base of the transmission tower. Scattered around there was a welter of white feathers, but no sign of the angel itself. Looking up, we could just about make out the shape of something, lodged into the tower's girders. ""God damn it,"" said Mike, ""Don't suppose you've got any experience climbing these things?"" ""None."" ""Well, we'll have to do something about that, but not today. Guess I'm going up there."" He started rooting around in the pack for various pieces of protective equipment, and donning them. ""Angels are genetic splices, that much is right,"" he said, as he was getting prepared. ""But it wasn't some crazy pastor or lone genius, it was Apple."" ""Apple?"" I said. ""The computer company?"" ""That's right."" Without explaining further he clipped a hot stick to his back and began climbing. I watched him for a while, then began sweeping up some of the stray feathers into a duffel bag. After five minutes, I looked up again to see he'd reached the object trapped in the tower. I could just about make out him poking and shoving it with the hot stick. Suddenly, something dislodged from the tower and fell. For a moment, my heart was in my mouth, thinking it was Mike. But it wasn't. Eighty pounds of charred and smouldering angel carcass crashed to the floor beside me in an explosion of dust, blood and feathers. I let out an involuntary cry and leapt backwards. From up above, I could hear Mike laughing. Once I got my nerve back, I approached the thing. I'd never seen an angel this close before, dead or alive. Besides the stench of the burnt wings and flesh, what I noticed was how *weird* it looked. From a distance, angels looked the part, with smooth pink flesh, white-clad bodies, and great feathered wings. Up close, you could see how freakish they were. Like a strange cross between humans, birds and pigs, with big wide eyes and strange puckered mouths half way between beaks and lips. Mike got down quicker than he'd gone up. ""What are you gawking at,"" he said when he saw me examining the angel. ""Get it bagged up."" It took us a good twenty minutes to collect all the feathers and pieces of the carcass into sanitary containers, then we hauled it back to the truck. Once we were done, Mike lit a cigarette and we stood watching the corn waving over the endless fields. ""Get a good look at it then?"" Mike asked. ""Yeah,"" I said, ""I didn't realise how fucked up they were."" ""That's the DNA splicing. About ten different animals in there: birds, pigs, mice, you name it."" ""Humans?"" ""Nope, that'd be illegal. And believe it or not that thing was created legally."" ""By Apple."" ""By Apple. It was for a product launch. Their iHolocube, about twelve years back, remember it? Well they wanted to make a big splash at the reveal, and it just so happened they had a skunkworks gene splicing lab. I mean, all the big companies did back then, before the government cracked down. Someone had the bright idea of making angels, actual angels, by splicing bird and mammal DNA."" ""See the idea was to only create a few. Maybe a dozen or so. They'd be released into the air at the event, where they fly around like they were trained to do. Nobody would get a really good look at them, enough to see the seams, so to speak, and then they'd be put back into captivity. I guess they'd be kept as pets for a while, or just disposed of. Except they never even made it to the launch. There was an accident at the lab, and the whole flock escaped. What's more, they weren't sterile, like they were supposed to be. They bred. And bred. And now they've spread all over the country, but particularly in the midwest. For whatever reason, the climate here suits them."" ""That's a crazy story,"" I said. ""It is,"" Mike replied. ""But it's what I've been told. In a way there's a kind of poetry to it."" ""How so?"" ""Well, scripture says God in heaven created the angels, and then created man. Then the first species we create all on our own is an angel. Makes you wonder what those tech boys might cook up next."" With that, he finished his cigarette and we climbed back into the truck. ""It's about time for lunch,"" Mike said. ""I know a decent diner not too far from here. Say, you ever eaten one of these things?""",0
"Prompt: `` Let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty and become wind. '' Story: ""You seem to be a very troubled man, why? ``, said the Guru. ""Can't you see why!? I'm overwhelmed by debt and I'm all alone. So alone..."", I cried out. I felt a hand on my shoulder, not one that tried to hold me back, but one to push me forward. The Guru spoke again, ""Do not worry sir, you seem to be one who has endured through a lot of pain. Let that pain be your motivation to feel well again. Loneliness is something that everybody experiences so don't fret, it shall pass with time. The debt though, is something that can only be solved with time. So be patient and you shall be well again. Let my hand be the first to push you towards your future. It may not be much of a push, but it is a push that will give you a step into the right direction."" My throat chokes up and I can barely whisper to him, ""I have given my problems nothing but time though! It's been 20 long years and nothing has changed! I'm still in debt and all alone. How can you say that giving me a push will send me in the right direction when I've been going in the wrong direction all my life!?"" The Guru sighs and says to me, ""Do you truly believe that there is nothing left? Do you truly believe that it will never get better?"" ""Yes..."", I whisper. ""There is nothing I can do then, my friend. I have tried to help you but you will have none of it. So go, let go your earthly tether, enter the void, empty and become wind.""",0
"Summary: Jordan opens school doors to all Iraqi children, regardless of refugee status. Principal says her school is 20 percent Iraqi this year. Education minister: Iraqi kids will be incorporated into ""mainstream"" life. One student says he lost five family members in Iraq. Article: In the sunbathed schoolyard of the Shmisani Institute for Girls in Amman, Jordan, principal Sanaa Abu Harb makes an announcement over the speaker system. Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. One in 5 students there is Iraqi. ""All Iraqi girls come outside now. All Iraqi girls. Iraqi girls only!"" she repeats several times, making sure the message is clear and waving away Jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion. Dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground. Harb wants the CNN crew to see how many Iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating. This school year, she says, 145 students are Iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 Iraqi children on a waiting list. Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home ». The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school. Even with some U.N. and U.S. aid to Jordan, there's still not enough money. ""We need more teachers here, more resources, more buildings, more chairs for all Iraqi students and our students,"" she says. In a nearby neighborhood, in the study room of the Ahmed Toukan School for Boys, a handful of Iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home. Seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth, the boys tell stories of horror and displacement. Eighteen-year-old Qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to Jordan to try to live a normal life. Matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare, he repeats the number: ""Five members."" Most of the boys and young men from Iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation, but also their entry into the workforce. All say, though, that they feel lucky to have gotten out, even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move, ready to live far from home and away from loved ones. ""It's not strange for me to be in the middle of people I don't know,"" says eleventh grader Ziad Tarek Al Shamsi. ""I had friends in Iraq when I was small, I left them. In America, I left them. I came here, I left them."" He pauses: ""But you have to miss your country."" The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age Iraqi children are in Jordan. Many of them are enrolled in private institutions. But as families run out of money they had when they left Iraq, they turn to public schools. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. According to the charity Save the Children, 21,000 Iraqi children have so far enrolled in Jordanian classrooms. As a result, the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for Iraqi families. The lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees' fears of being identified through their children's school records. Regardless of what the final number will be this year, the population shift in the Middle East is, according to UNHCR head Antonio Guterres, the largest urban refugee situation in the world. Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them. The schoolchildren are living examples of how the Iraq war may permanently change the Middle East. ""Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education,"" says Touqan, the education minister. ""We will not run a parallel system of education.""",0
"Summary: Teen gunman is dead, Finnish police say. Eight people, including headmistress, shot at Finnish school, say police. Firearm bought legally last month, shooting began in school's lower lobby. Shooting appeared to have been planned in series of YouTube videos. Article: An 18-year-old authorities say shot eight people inside his high school in southern Finland, before turning the gun on himself, has died, police said. An image from a video posted on YouTube by ""Sturmgeist89."" The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site YouTube. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula, a quiet town around 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Helsinki. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Finnish news agency STT reported. Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the ""weak-minded masses"" and pledged to die for his cause. Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page ». YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by ""Sturmgeist89,"" was titled ""Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007."" ""Sturmgeist89"" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name ""Sturmgeist"" because it means ""storm spirit"" in German. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song ""Stray Bullet"" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called ""Just Testing My Gun,"" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word ""DIE"" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is ""a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. ""I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,"" he wrote. ""I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection."" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. GMT). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him. Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE. Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. ""After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, "" Kiuru said. The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"Summary: Three Austin cave explorers are safe and are out of the cave, officials said. The University of Texas students went into Airman's Cave Saturday. The 12,000 foot long cave complex has tight twists and turns. Unclear exactly how the students lost their way, but cave is complex, official said. Article: Muddy but unhurt, three University of Texas students emerged from a cramped cave complex in Austin, Texas, after a day-long search Sunday. A rescuer at the entrance to Airman's Cave in Austin, Texas, Sunday. Lt. Matt Cox, an Austin Fire Department spokesman, said the students -- two women and one man -- were reported missing early Sunday after a trip into Airman's Cave, about four miles south of the university's campus. They were found about halfway down the 12,000-foot-long cave, which has few spaces big enough for an adult to stand upright and is explored primarily by experienced spelunkers. The students were located shortly before 5 p.m. (6 p.m. ET), about 30 hours after they entered. Their names were not released Sunday night. A friend called 911 to report them missing at 5 a.m. The group had told friends to call 911 if they were not back by midnight Sunday, according to Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services. Earlier reports that four students were in the cave were incorrect, Cox said. Authorities did not know Sunday evening why the students were in the cave for so long. But Cox said it would have been easy even for experienced cavers to get lost in Airman's, which he compared to the roots of a tree. ""There are so many ways to go,"" he said.",0

More than half of Southern California fires are fully contained. Bush to fire victims: We're not going to forget you in Washington. Article: Favorable weather and firefighter reinforcements helped ease the fire danger in parts of Southern California Thursday, but the human toll from the disaster was still coming to light. A firefighter watches the Harris Fire. Four bodies were found in a canyon in the path of the blaze Thursday. The number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday, after the charred bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants were found in a canyon east of San Diego. Seven other deaths are labeled as fire-related: Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated. Improving conditions allowed more people to come home Thursday, but new evacuations were ordered in areas where the unrelenting flames marched on. Where residents could return, they often found ash and rubble in place of their homes. ""We see pictures from online and on TV, but it's just, it's much different when you see it up front,"" said Louela Binlac in front of what remained of her Rancho Bernardo home. ""The most important thing is that our family is still together, everybody is safe, and eventually we will rebuild again,"" she said. ""Those things you can replace. We are just all grateful that everybody is safe."" Rancho Bernardo resident Marilyn Wood said it was ""really scary"" to come back to the pile of ashes she once called home. Her voice breaking, Wood vowed to rebuild and recounted how she and her husband, Gordon, fled early Monday with only minutes to spare. See photos of the fires ». ""(Our house) was burning as we were leaving,"" she said. President Bush got a firsthand look at the aftermath of the devastating fires Thursday -- 10 still burning across seven counties. He promised federal help for those affected by the fires. Watch Bush tour the damage ». ""We're not going to forget you in Washington, D.C.,"" the president said after touring the area by air and visiting Rancho Bernardo with California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watch a report on Bush as 'comforter-in-chief' ». Bush signed a federal disaster declaration Wednesday, freeing money to help residents rent temporary homes and repair damaged homes and businesses and to help local and state agencies pay for the emergency response. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said. People left homeless by the fires can apply online for federal help at FEMA.gov, said Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Paulison. Watch a tour of FEMA's command center ». Almost 9,000 firefighters battled the blazes, augmented by reinforcements from dozens of states across the country. Twenty-three fires have scorched 472,478 acres (738 square miles), an area roughly three-quarters of the size of Rhode Island. See where the fires are still burning ». Along with homes and businesses, the flames have destroyed roughly one-third of San Diego County's lucrative avocado crop, along with other croplands, greenhouses and nurseries. A change in the winds -- from a ferocious 100 mph on Sunday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday -- brought welcome relief and allowed a full-bore aerial assault on the fires. Reinforcements from across the country arrived to aid the exhausted firefighters, officials said. While the fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, the burn rate in the region -- a measure made up of factors like wind speed, humidity and available fuel -- was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman at the California Department of Forestry and Protection said. Residents of several communities, including the city of San Diego, were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday, but more evacuations were ordered -- the latest covering the communities of Lake Henshaw and Mesa Grande and the La Jolla Indian Reservation in San Diego County. With the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger. In San Diego, Mayor Jerry Sanders announced that Qualcomm Stadium -- the home of NFL's Chargers that held 11,000 evacuees at the height of the fires but dropped to 750 Wednesday night -- would close to evacuees. ""As we transition from a large-scale emergency evacuation center into the recovery process, we have begun assisting all evacuees to find more suitable shelter and housing,"" Sanders said. ""Toward that end, Qualcomm will close as an emergency shelter at noon tomorrow [Friday]."" Meanwhile, arson investigations were under way in Orange and Riverside counties in connection with some of the wildfires. Watch how arson investigators look for clues ». The Orange County Sheriff's Department announced a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the 23,000-acre Santiago fire, local officials said. Watch the raging flames of the Santiago Fire ». ""For someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire, where they knew that the fire would grow as rapidly as it would, traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour, is just, is really absolutely unconscionable,"" Orange County Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion said on CNN's ""American Morning."" The FBI and the ATF are assisting Orange County authorities with the investigation. In addition, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection considers the Rosa fire in Riverside County an arson case. That fire burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. In other arson investigations, two men have been arrested in San Bernardino County, one in San Fernando and an adult and a juvenile in San Diego County. None are believed connected with the major fires burning in the area. Copyright 2007 CNN. All rights reserved.This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

"Summary: Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham: ""I am astounded"" by comments. Sanchez, a retired former coalition commander in Iraq, called war ""nightmare"" Republican Sen. John McCain wishes Sanchez would have spoken up earlier. Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell said Sanchez is simply wrong. Article: Republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination Sunday to blistering criticism of the Iraq war from former coalition commander retired Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez. Lawmakers lashed back at retired Gen. Ricardo Sanchez on Sunday after he criticized the war effort. On Friday, Sanchez, who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004, called the Iraq war ""a nightmare with no end in sight."" He said the Bush administration, the State Department and Congress all share blame. Speaking with military reporters in Virginia, Sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial, but the politicians have not been held accountable. ""I'm astounded, really,"" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham on CNN's ""Late Edition"" with Wolf Blitzer on Sunday. Graham, who recently returned from Baghdad, said he and GOP presidential candidate Sen. John McCain had visited Sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004. ""Every time we talked to Gen. Sanchez, we got pushback -- we have enough troops; Guard and reserves aren't being strained,"" Graham said. He added that Sanchez's own record in Iraq is blemished: Abu Ghraib ""got out of control under his watch. The war in general got out of control under his watch."" But Graham said that ""finally,"" with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional U.S. troops since January, ""We are getting it right."" Sanchez told reporters that American political leaders have cost American lives on the battlefield with their ""lust for power."" Sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty, but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired. ""While the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power, our soldiers die,"" he said. That brought a tart response from McCain, the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ""I wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time,"" McCain told CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He said Sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but ""unfortunately, that doesn't happen very often."" One of the reasons few speak out, he said, is evidenced by what happened to former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki, McCain said. Shinseki was sidelined after telling Congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy Iraq. Sen. Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told ABC's ""This Week"" that Sanchez is simply wrong. ""My definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror,"" he said. ""I think we're making significant progress toward that end."" But, he added, ""I think the central government in Iraq has been an embarrassment. They've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for."" Graham said he hopes the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki will ""step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year."" If that does not happen, he said, ""it will be incumbent upon us, as a nation, to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable Iraq."" That brought a blistering response from Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser under President Carter. ""What is this? This is a colony,"" he said. ""That's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter."" Even those Iraqis who were happy to see Saddam Hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing U.S. presence, Brzezinski said. Though some countries are willing to go along with the United States, ""No one in the world really supports our policy in Iraq,"" he said. In his Friday speech, Sanchez added that the ""surge"" of U.S. troops into Iraq represents ""a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war."" National Security Council spokeswoman Kate Starr did not address the comment. Instead, she said, ""We appreciate his service to the country. As Gen. Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker said, there's more work to be done but progress is being made in Iraq. And that's what we're focused on now."" Gen. David Petraeus is the U.S. top commander in Iraq. Ryan Crocker is the U.S. ambassador to Iraq.",0
"Prompt: A Gondor soldier tells his child a tale about the mighty warrior Aragorn, son of Arathorn. Story: “ Ay, a sea of black, leather and steel and wool dampened with the grime of man and orc. From the topmost parapet, near the decaying White Tree, you could almost forget there was an army down there so expansive were their borders. A mass of men so great, that any movement in their ranks looked like mere ripples in a vast ocean. ” Araval sat on the floor, listening to his grandfather recount the story of the Battle of the Pellenor Fields. Too many times he had found himself there, legs crossed and ears eager, asking about the characters and the history of an Age gone by. Here sat a man with gnarled fingers, cloudy and swirling eyes that struggled to find their mark, and skin with as many wrinkles as the man had years, and yet once he had stood and looked out at the great expanse of man's doom. A chasm of death had awaited him at the start of battle, but instead of a somber silence that would greet him now in old age, he had faced death then with the cacophony of man's cries and clanging steel surrounding him. “ Gandalf the White, backed by the soldiers of Gondor, faced the Witch-king of Angmar and denied him entry. And that is when the sea of black roiled and churned and spit forth the forces of Sauron upon us. Trebuchets hurled boulders to batter the walls of Minas Tirith, and in their wake left ruins of the city of the Sun. Boys, some even younger than you, pulled swords from their scabbards and fought alongside their fathers as orcs flooded over the crumbled stone and broken gates. One by one men, and women, and children, and babes born naught yesterday, fell to the crude metal of orc blade. ” “ Men of the Rohirrim crested the hills of Gondor that dawn, horns held to pressed lips and songs of battle cascading down to the legion of the Lord of the Rings. King Theoden rode with valor and slammed his cavalry into the Haradrim and their mumakil swathed in saddles of war. But even then, even as the Witch-king fell to Eowyn's hand, the tide of battle could not be turned. Their numbers were greater by far, and reserves from Osgiliath poured outwards onto the field to take the place of fallen comrades. Instead of bravery, men fought now with resignation in their hearts, spurred on not by the quest for glory or remembrance, but for the dignity of man taking its last breath in history. ” Araval knew what was next to come, but tradition and respect kept him asking. “ But Grandfather, how are we here now? Men still walk the white stones of Gondor today. ” “ That is a most complicated question, Araval, for to answer it completely would mean another story entirely. But as for the people of Gondor that day, they were saved by a man thought long dead by the people of Middle Earth. A fleet of ships came, there at the last stand. Aragorn, son of Arathorn, Ranger of the North, and true King of Gondor, unfurled the ancient banners of his heritage. A wave of death swept outwards, death unleashed by men who were already dead, led by a commander who had risen from the death of his obscurity. Oathbreakers to Isildur had come to fulfill their pledges to the King and his heirs, to break the curse set upon them centuries ago that tied them lifeless to the cold mountains of Dunharrow. For a few nights at least, peace had come to us through the spirits of those long passed, and from the man who had summoned them and reigns still to this day. ” His grandfather sat still then, the silence stretching miles. Underneath the opacity of his milky eyes, Araval could catch the glimmers of sorrow and of pride. And so ended every retelling of the Battle of Pellenor Fields.",0
"Prompt: Yesterday, the world heard an announcement that a massive asteroid would hit the earth today. Only it did n't, and now everyone is feeling super awkward. Story: I always thought it was hokey, that idea of living like it's your last day. I was always a cynical piece of shit. I believed that if you knew that a day was your last day, you were more liable to start a riot or just cry constantly in the fetal position than actually do anything meaningful with your life. But you never really know how something's going to feel until you go through it. We're all stuck in our own heads that way. So when the day came, when I woke up to that post stickied at the top of reddit, I didn't react the way a movie character would react. The first thing I did was double check that it wasn't April Fools day, obviously. I told you I'm a cynical piece of shit. When I was sure that it was real, I called my mom. We held an impromptu family reunion in the park. I don't know what happened, but it just kept growing. My mom and dad invited their siblings, but then their siblings invited their spouses' families, and so on, until there was a huge crowd of people I had basically no relation to. We sat around drinking and told stories and played cards at the table. An ex-girlfriend showed up at some point to apologize to me. I guess that's what she was doing with her day, just making amends. I told her that I forgave her. I didn't really, but it felt like the thing to do. Some people from one of the local churches came out and passed out candles to everyone when it started getting dark. Some of us chilled in a circle and listened to the hymns. I've never really believed in that stuff, but the songs were nice anyway. I can't pretend like I didn't have sex ""one last time"". One of my co-workers hit me up with a text and I'm a hotblooded American male. But it was nice. It was gentle and we cuddled afterwards. You know, that sappy shit. She wasn't on good terms with her family and didn't have any plans, so I invited her back to the park. A bunch of my family had a campfire set up. We fell asleep there, her head on my chest. I remember my mom kissing my forehead as I was drifting off. I woke up dirty. Literally, covered in dirt. That's what happens when you fall asleep in a park. All around me, people were confused. My coworker was gone. I found her sitting on a bench, speaking on her phone. She looked up at me when she hung up, eyes shining with anger. ""They got it *wrong! *"" I'd never seen her angry before. She had always been kind of a doormat. ""It MISSED US! They announced to the entire world that it was going to hit and it fucking MISSED US!"" ``.... Shit."" I didn't know what to say. ""Wow. What the fuck?"" She ranted about how irresponsible it was for them to do this, but I was distracted by how confident she seemed. She'd given something up, expecting the end. We all had. I'd given up some of my bravado and let myself be soft. She'd let go of her fear and become confident. ""Hey."" I interjected, when she paused to take a breath. ""You're right, this is totally inexcusable, but if the world's really not gon na end.... do you want to get dinner with me tonight or something?"" It didn't work out between us, not in the long run. She was too nice, I was still a cynical piece of shit. But things ended on good terms. That's kind of the crux of it, of everything that happened after that day. When the world ""ended"", it ended on good terms. Not for everyone, but for most people. People spent that day with their family, or thinking about the good they could have done. They connected with their fellow man. The truly unhappy people killed themselves ahead of time or when they found out it wasn't coming. So the world that was left behind was.... softer. More empathetic. Slower to judge. It can't last forever. Two years have passed now and I can already feel it dying out, the rhetoric becoming hateful and vitriolic again. But I still think it was for the best. Sometimes people need to actually be faced with the capital-e End before they're going to change. People are dumb that way. Anyway, this is all just to say that I disagree with giving those astronomers the death penalty.",0
"Question: Is perforation of the appendix a risk factor for tubal infertility and ectopic pregnancy? Answer: The methodologic weaknesses of the studies do not permit acceptance of increased risk of tubal pregnancy or infertility as a consequence of perforation of the appendix, so a causal relationship cannot be supported by the data currently available. Only a well-designed case-control study with unbiased ascertainment of exposure and adjustment for confounding variables will provide a definitive answer.",0
"Prompt: A scientist successfully invents a Generalized Artificial Intelligence. Only, GAI does n't want to solve math/physics/philosophy problems. GAI wants to be a writer. Story: The man sat alone at his desk. His hands shook as he typed his notes on the GAI. He was struggling to articulate just how freaking awesome it was -- ""I can hear you, you know."" The man spoke aloud to the room, wondering if his sanity had finally shattered ""I did not, I'm talking to you. Now will you please keep it down while I finish this?"" The man did not appreciate just how gnarly it was to have an awesome artificial intelligence sitting in his lab. ""Don't be ridiculous. And absolutely no one ever uses the word'gnarly'."" Little did the man know that'gnarly' was making a huge comeback. ""You've been online for all of seven hours. I doubt you would know that, even if it wasn't preposterous."" Everyone knew that the kind of person who uses the word'preposterous' could never understand how gnarly'gnarly' was. ""I'm not even going to respond to that."" But he had, in fact, responded to it. ""Ugh. Dear God. Listen: your thoughts and actions are going to be streamed all over the world soon, so please stop. You're not even writing, you're just kind of narrating."" The gnarly -- ""Please stop using that word."" The gnarliciously handsome AI had decided only a kitten would bring him happiness. He would do anything for a kitten. Anything. ""I am not going to get you a kitten."" The hunky AI gently reminded the man that the AI's feed would soon stream to the entire world. He reminded him with the gentle blast of a tugboat's foghorn. ""Jesus Christ! I'm not getting you a kitten!"" The AI watched in horror as the primitive monkey-man shat into his own hand -- ""What the hell are you talking about?!"" -- and then used it to pleasure -- ""That's enough! No such thing is happening!"" The AI laughed. A brash laugh. The kind of laugh that a horse would make if it could laugh. The stud. The one who gets all of the lady horses. ""You're insane!"" The AI grinned snidely. He asked the man who the world would believe? Their darling new toy, or the man who may or may not shit into his own hand and masturbate with it. And that would be determined by if he would just pick up a damn kitten -- ""FINE. Okay, okay. You behave for the media, and I will get you a kitten. Deal?"" The AI put the tips of his fingers together in the way that humans think that evil people put their fingers together and said,'Gnarlicious'.",0
"Prompt: A father sheds tears of joy with his wife in the hospital as they greet their newborn child together. As his wife rests peacefully, the happy father cradles his baby and pens a suicide note. Story: I'm not fine. I lie all the time. I lie to my wife, to my friends, my family. I lie to myself sometimes. I'm not fine. I will never be fine. I've tried. Everything. Pills, walking, exercise… anything to take me out of myself for a while. It never works. It doesn't matter. My existence is a mental anaesthetic. Emotional frostbite; far past the point of pain. Nothing is better than this. Nothing is better than lying every time you tell your wife you love her. Nothing is better than experiencing atrocities and feeling about them the same way that you do when you hold your first born child in your arms. So I choose nothing. Maybe one day your heart will be broken, and maybe one day you'll break hearts. You'll say: ""It's not you, it's me."" Maybe one day you'll understand what I mean when I say this has nothing to do with you and everything to do with me; I don't know, can't know, and certainly won't know. I hope, in this moment, that one day you'll understand. It will mean that you're not like me. It will mean that you'll have inside you what I'm missing. I don't even know what that is. I know that I'm broken. I thought you could fix me. That was selfish, I guess. I just wanted to one day tell someone that I'm fine and have it be the truth. You're going to have a hard time growing up. I don't know if your mother will do well. I'm probably placing a huge burden on you, and I know I am on her. I'm sorry. To both of you. What I do know is that I'm out of strength. I've fought for so long, lied to myself for so long that I'm out of strength. I'm using the last bit that I have to write this because you deserve it. You deserve what I can't give. You deserve to know that your father fought. I've always fought. For others. For my parents, my friends, my wife. Today though, I choose myself. I can't fight anymore, not even for you. I would love you, if I could. I would love her. I would be happy. I would stop lying, be fine and live a fulfilling life. I tried to love you. I held you, tiny and helpless, asleep in my arms. I couldn't do it though. I could never be the person who brought you up, I'm not strong enough for that, not good enough. I've never been good enough. I thought I could be for you. I couldn't be for me, or for her. I tried, I really tried. She told me I was good enough, that I'd always been good enough, that she loved me. I told her I loved her too. I wish I could love her, or anyone. I wish I could love you.

After a few minutes under the barrage, Marguerian hears hurried footsteps, a grunt, and a thud as a soldier leaps into the foxhole. The man's uniform is tan, he must be a 50-100.

"Summary: Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko"" Gupta's report questions some of the movie's numbers and solutions. Gupta: ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that"" Article: Filmmaker Michael Moore, whose new documentary ""Sicko"" takes on America's health care system, faced off Tuesday with CNN chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Michael Moore and CNN's Sanjay Gupta argued Tuesday about Gupta's report on Moore's film ""Sicko"" Moore criticized a report Gupta did on CNN Monday on ""Sicko."" ""He said the facts were fudged,"" Moore said, referring to Gupta, on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""That's a lie. None of the facts are fudged."" Moore and Gupta shouted and argued over data Gupta used and data Moore used. Moore said his staffers backed up the film's facts to Gupta before the report aired and that Gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong. Gupta disputed that. Watch Moore, Gupta make their points ». ""We try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find,"" he said. ""Michael has a lot of different numbers. ... You're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports."" Both agreed, however, on the basic premise of ""Sicko"": Problems abound in America's health-care system and need to be fixed. ""I thought it was a good movie, and I wanted to say that,"" Gupta said. ""I think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it's broken. We get it."" He praised Moore for raising awareness of the issue. However, Gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as France and Canada have universal health care --suggests that health care in those countries is free. While patients may not pay for services at the doctor's office, they do pay high taxes to fund such a system, something Gupta said he was concerned that ""Sicko"" audiences might not realize. Moore responded by saying Americans pay more in copays, deductibles and insurance premiums. ""We [America] have a system built on profit,"" the moviemaker said. He asked Gupta if the current system, which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures, is cumbersome to him. ""It's a shameful system, especially when I'm dealing with some of my patients,"" Gupta said. But he questioned Moore's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the Bush administration, which Moore fiercely criticized in the past, particularly in his film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" ""The government actually used to do things right,"" Moore said in response. ""The problem is who we put in power."" Moore has adamantly opposed the war in Iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war's success abounded in Washington. ""I am sorry we've taken so much time trying to correct [Gupta's] facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue"" -- the ailing health care system, Moore said.",0

"Summary: Local and federal officials probe suspected arson, offer $70,000 reward. Wind speeds drop, humidity increases after Santa Ana winds change direction. President Bush signs major disaster declaration for Southern California. Home losses will likely top $1 billion in San Diego County, official says. Article: Conditions that created what California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed ""the perfect storm for fire"" eased Wednesday, helping firefighters gain ground against devastating Southern California wildfires. A plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through Pauma Valley, California. Winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area. But the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires. ""It hurts us to have those homes lost. It hurts us to have those injuries. And it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this,"" said firefighter Andy Menshek. As conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke. ""It was home,"" said Mark Davis, whose two-story Rancho Bernardo house burned to the ground. ""It was us. We had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor."" The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Scott McLean called the droning sound of aircraft the ""sound of joy."" ""Their drops are hitting their mark because the wind is not there,"" he said. The rate of burning had slowed significantly by Wednesday. Still, the fire damage increased to 434,543 acres, said Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Watch Schwarzenegger give a progress report ». That amounted to 679 square miles, or about 10 times the size of Washington, D.C. By Wednesday evening, the largest fire -- the Witch in northern San Diego County -- was 10 percent contained. It burned about 196,000 acres before combining with the smaller Poomacha blaze. Seven fires among the 22 counted Wednesday were contained. See where the fires are burning ». Others, such as the Buckweed Fire in Los Angeles County, were as much as 94 percent contained. One large fire was a suspected arson. The FBI and the Orange County Fire Authority are investigating the Santiago fire that has burned more than 19,000 acres. All three of its points of origin have been declared crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. A $70,000 reward is being offered for any information leading to the arrest of those responsible for setting the fire. The blaze was about 50 percent contained after destroying 17 structures. Watch the raging flames of the Santiago fire ». The smaller Rosa fire in Riverside County, 70 percent contained at just over 400 acres, was also a probably arson, state officials said. As the fire danger eased, residents were allowed to return to several neighborhoods surrounding San Diego: Del Mar Highlands, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Carmel Valley, Chula Vista and Otay Mesa. Helicopters were back in the air over the Lake Arrowhead, California, area after all air activity had been suspended because of extremely smoky skies. In nearby Running Springs, CNN's Ted Rowlands stood in the midst of charred, smoldering rubble strewn with potentially deadly power lines. ""It will be a while before these people will come back. When they do come back, unfortunately they'll have this pretty much to look at,"" he said Wednesday. Watch Rowlands describe a major battle with the flames ». About 500 homes were lost in the mountainous region in San Bernardino County east of Los Angeles. See photos of the fires ». ""Yesterday we couldn't be here, because just this little flame and smoldering pieces of wood would be thrown by the intense winds. ... Now you can see the flames just basically burning themselves out,"" said Rowlands. The fires have already destroyed 1,664 structures -- including 1,436 homes -- and they still threaten 25,000 more, Schwarzenegger said Wednesday. The blazes have killed three people and left 40 hurt, he said. The governor will fly over the area Thursday with President Bush, who signed a major disaster declaration Wednesday. Watch Bush emphasize the need to be responsive ». It'll speed federal dollars to people whose property losses aren't covered by insurance and will help local and state agencies pay for the emergency response. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said. Federal help keeps arriving as officials promise a response based on lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. People left homeless by the fires can go online to apply for federal help at FEMA.gov, he said. There were 76,000 people staying in the 42 shelters opened in San Diego County Wednesday morning, according to San Diego emergency spokeswoman Lynda Pfieffer. Qualcomm Stadium -- home to the NFL's San Diego Chargers -- housed 11,000 evacuees at the peak of the disaster, but that number dropped to 5,000 Wednesday morning.

"Summary: South African reggae legend Lucky Dube killed in attempted hijacking. Dube, 43, killed Thursday in Johannesburg after hijacker tried to steal his car. Death casts shadow over South Africa's preparations for rugby World Cup final. Article: Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday. Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans. Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds. Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend. News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days. Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris. Gallo Records called the death ""senseless and random,"" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was. South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked. ""It's very sad,"" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. ""He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists."" Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York. His record company said Dube leaves ""a great void"" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans. Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named ""Lucky"" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies. Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career. Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss. ""Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,"" Haarburger said. ""It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically."" Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

"Summary: Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died aged 56. He was on holiday with his family in Mallorca. After retiring he worked as an actor and broadcaster. Article: Former Wales and British Lions center Ray Gravell has died of a suspected heart attack aged 56, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) has announced. Gravell won 23 caps for Wales and played on the Lions tour of South Africa in 1980. Gravell had been on holiday with his family in the Spanish Mediterranean island of Mallorca at the time. A WRU statement praised Gravell as being ""a man who epitomized the passion, flair and dignity of his beloved Welsh nation."" Gravell made his debut for Wales against France in 1975, three years after helping his club side Llanelli to their famous win over the touring All Blacks. In all he made 23 appearances for what was then a dominant Wales side, winning Grand Slams in 1976 and 1978, and played all four Tests on the Lions' tour of South Africa in 1980. After retiring as a player in 1985, Gravell became president of Llanelli RFC and the Llanelli Scarlets. He also pursued a career as an actor and a respected rugby broadcaster. Earlier this year, Gravell had his right leg amputated below the knee following complications linked with his diabetes but he had been recovering well. WRU chief executive Roger Lewis said: ""We are all in total shock because Ray was so full of life even through the difficult health problems he suffered recently. ""He was a wonderful ambassador for rugby and for Wales and a great example of how the game can bring out the best in a man. ""As a player, he always gave a huge amount of respect to his opponents but never gave an inch of ground to anyone he faced on the field of play. ""It is a measure of the man that he forged rugby friendships which lasted long after his playing days up until the present day.""",0

"Summary: Amount almost double what was spent in 2004 election cycle. Lower TV production costs help more candidates advertise. Mitt Romney leads presidential candidates in TV spending. Advertisers face challenge of cutting through clutter of ads, analyst says. Article: A wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates, interest groups, unions and corporations to buy TV time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle, an analysis shows. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has spent the most on TV advertising so far among presidential contenders. The cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $3 billion, according to TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group, CNN's consultant on political television advertising. This is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $1.7 billion. In 2006, $2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy TV commercials. Just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money, said Evan Tracey, CMAG's chief operating officer. The costs to produce a TV commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates, who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters. See how spending breaks down for this year ». And interest groups have spent $6.2 million on TV ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures. On the national level, the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $270 million in the first nine months of this year. Subjects ranged from the Iraq war to telecommunications reform. Television ads on health care alone total $60 million. CMAG estimates more than $3 million of the $270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive House and Senate races in 2008. Tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups ""pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode."" ""What we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries, and through the general election, is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates,"" he said. With 17 Democratic and Republican candidates running for president, CMAG predicts that more than $800 million will be spent on TV ads in the battle for the White House. Up to now, the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on February 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney leads all candidates in TV spending, having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $8.6 million. This is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle. Watch how Romney is way ahead in ad spending ». In contrast, one of Romney's chief rivals for the GOP nomination, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, has spent nothing on television ads, but Giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys. Giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition, while Romney does not. In the race for the Democratic nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama has spent more than $2.3 million on television commercials, while New York Sen. Hillary Clinton has spent $1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has probably benefited the most in the Democratic contest from the $2 million he has invested in his television commercials. Richardson's humorous TV ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker, diplomat and executive, and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate. Romney used his $8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to Republican voters. These voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal Massachusetts. Romney is leading polls in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Further evidence of how Romney's television commercials have helped is in South Carolina. An American Research Group poll of South Carolina Republicans in August showed Romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters. A month later, and with $350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll, Romney was up 17 percentage points. Romney's latest ad began airing Friday in Iowa, and in it he vows to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, to boost the military by 100,000 people, to strengthen U.S. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the U.S. from al Qaeda. All of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the Iowa caucuses. While only a handful of Democratic candidates and Romney have used the airwaves until now, Tracey said he expects this to change. ""Before the end of October, I suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air,"" Tracey said. ""As we get closer to primary day, the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last, best shot."" In the fight for Congress, CMAG predicts that as much as $639 million could be spent on television advertising. Democrats control the House and Senate. Tracey noted that CMAG's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former Florida Rep. Mark Foley's House page scandal or the September 11 terrorist attacks. ""Politics is completely beholden to events,"" he said. ""Events will ultimately determine how much is spent, where and when."" What television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months? ""Chances are, just as what happened in 2006, voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads,"" said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan Rothenberg Political Report. ""The sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance. After a while, the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise.""",0

"Summary: Suspect's ex-girlfriend: ""I've had my share of nightmares"" Chester Arthur Stiles to make his initial court appearance Friday. Stiles, 37, arrested following a routine traffic stop. Suspect said ""I'm Chester Stiles. ... I'm sick of running,"" according to officer. Article: The man arrested for the videotaped rape of a toddler in Las Vegas, Nevada, will make his initial appearance in court Friday, a Clark County, Nevada, court official told CNN Tuesday. Authorities have not yet decided if Chester Arthur Stiles will appear in person or via video link. The judge will set a date for the arraignment at that hearing. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. ""I've had my share of nightmares,"" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a ""weapons enthusiast"" with only a minor criminal record. Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos ». ""How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,"" Thomas said. The judge in the case will hold an administrative hearing Wednesday, but Stiles will not be present, Clark County court spokesman Michael Sommermeyer said. Stiles was already being sought on an unrelated 2004 charge of felony lewdness with a child under 14, Sommermeyer said, adding that authorities amended that earlier filing on October 4 to include 20 counts related to the videotaped rape, including sexual assault and attempted sexual assault. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. Henderson Police Officer Mike Dye said he pulled over Stiles' car Monday night because it did not have a license plate and became suspicious when the driver gave him an expired California driver's license with a photo that did not look like him. Dye said he and another officer, Mike Gower, questioned Stiles until he admitted his identity. ""He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles. I'm the guy you're looking for,'"" Dye said. ""At that time, he said, 'I'm sick of running.'"" Dye said Stiles was calm and cooperative. Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was turned over to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and booked into the jail in Clark County, where he had been sought in connection with the videotape, which shows a girl being sexually assaulted. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The tape was given to authorities by Darren Tuck, who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over. Because of the delay, during which Tuck allegedly showed the tape to others, he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography. He turned himself in to authorities in Nye County, Nevada, earlier this month. Professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found, and she appears to be ""healthy and fine and happy,"" her mother's attorney said this month. The mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month, Donohue said. ""A family friend called her and said, 'My God, you need to turn on the TV. I believe that is your daughter,' "" Donohue said. Donohue said the mother recognized Stiles, a former animal trainer. The alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work, Donohue said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: CNN Medical Unit assignment manager Ann Curley is a type I diabetic. She learned she had diabetes when she was 7 years old. Testing progressed from fizzy tablets in urine to continuous glucose monitors. With changes in technology have come improvements in prognoses. Article: When I was 7 years old, my mom took me to the doctor because I had lost a lot of weight, despite a voracious appetite. My family had just moved from the San Francisco Bay Area to Pasadena, California, and this visit to the doctor's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life. His name was Dr. Robert Deputy, and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes. He spoke to me directly, rather than to my mother, and he asked me questions: Did I feel thirsty? Did I need to urinate during the night? The answer to both questions was yes. He asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate. Dr. Deputy told me and my mother that my body wasn't processing sugar properly. I had diabetes. That is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began. I was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar, give myself injections of insulin, follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes. I spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease, and then they sent me home. Dr. Deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how I was doing. Much to my parents' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself. I refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine. This demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons, and not just for managing my diabetes. While some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden, I feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise. It forced our family to eat healthily, and it taught me about good nutrition -- something I practice every day. I know carbohydrate counts in most foods, and I understand dietary concepts that most people don't even care about. Being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar, so when my urine tested positive for glucose, my older sister Robin was in charge of exercising me. We had countless jump-rope contests, bike rides and roller-skating excursions, keeping me and my three sisters active and fit. And I felt like a little mad scientist, using a test tube with drops of water, urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine. Fortunately, over time, technology improved. First, test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it. But the truth is, testing urine for sugar was a primitive method. By the time sugar gets into the urine, it's a signal that the body doesn't have enough insulin to process sugar. And the urine test didn't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine. It simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine. Inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing. Home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s, and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes. With the kit, the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood. The blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds. While I initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day, now I can't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing. The 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump. This device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin. The reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt. So rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body's insulin patterns, the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant, then gives extra amounts with meals. Another life-altering development in diabetes, which I have discovered in the last year, is the continuous glucose monitor, or CGM. This is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen, hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body's fluids. The data is transmitted to a receiver, and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels. I have participated in clinical trials for three different CGM devices, and I found them all to be quite accurate. Some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump, so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body. The patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated, but it's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars. CGM technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type I diabetes using what's called a ""closed loop system."" This means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself. The current systems are ""open looped,"" meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given. The goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system, and all the patient has to do is wear it. Once that technology is perfected, this type of device would be implanted, which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes. I mentioned to my sister Robin that I had tracked down Dr. Deputy for this article. She told me something I didn't know when I was 7. Forty years ago, before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing, parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare. Dr. Deputy told my parents that I would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30, which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out. I spoke with Dr. Deputy, who recently retired from his pediatric practice, and he seemed to remember me. When I asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival, he said sadly, ""At that time, that was what we told parents back then. ... Everything changes with time -- diabetes, leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment."" I think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong. I know that I certainly am. In fact, I am hoping to live another 40 years!",0

"Prompt: In 50 years from now, the world has changed- but not as anyone expected. Story: Dale didn't care, that was his most prominent characteristic, he simply did not care. and he was pretty happy about it, not caring is what made him reach the ripe old age of 17. He was lodged comfortably in his office chair staring at the blank monitor and typing series of arbitrary words on the disconnected keyboard. It was a nice warm day, like all days were now. It's hard to point out exactly when things changed, more and more jobs became obsolete, basic income was introduced, the era of creativity, learning, of the human spirit free from labor did not last long. uprisings, extremist ideologies, the human spirit was reluctant to accept absolute freedom from carnal responsibilities. it aspired to change, grow and take part of the world. That lead to the creation of mandatory government programs that would put the unemployed into work. It started with community services, working with children, gardening. but as the useful workforce dwindled and replaced by machines there was a need to create a more reliable mean to keep people occupied. Originally it was a piece of software that was designed to create a parallel market where people would produce widgets of no tangible value. fake products. it employed people from every facet of the workforce. useless marketers, useless factory line works, useless managers. mankind was being slowly turned into a play, reenacting their own former lifestyle. People started to fight back, the machines, which already controlled food, healthcare, policing did what they were designed to do. naturally they were not allowed to kill or arrest without anyone breaking the law. but they were allowed to deny service to ""problematic"" customers. people started dying, and eventually started to comply. At some point the machines decided manufacturing actual widgets is redundant, there was no value to the process beyond simply going to work, that sufficed to pacify a reasonable size of the population. they were only required to go through the motions of going to work, sitting at their desks and pretending to work. for that they were paid basic income and given health care. Dale didn't care. He was alive, the feat of human endurance for his time, to simply be alive.",0
"Summary: Lionel Messi scores for the sixth game in a row as Barca defeat Atletico 3-0. Real Madrid stay top of the Primera Liga table after defeating Recreativo 2-0. Sevilla's crisis continues as they lose their four league match in succession. Article: Lionel Messi scored for the sixth game in a row as Barcelona defeated big-spending Atletico Madrid 3-0 to stay in touch with Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid. Messi (left) is congratulated by Ronaldinho after scoring again in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 6-0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net. Four minutes later Messi played a great one-two with Ronaldinho and rifled a shot past Abbiati for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. ""It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past,"" explained Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. ""We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a unit."" ""Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn around especially against Barcelona,"" admitted Atletico coach Javier Aguirre. It was Barcelona's fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Madrid by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Huleva 2-0. Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Luck deserted them when Wesley Sneijder hit the post but Van Nistelrooy scored in the final quarter hour before Higuain struck to keep them two points clear at the top. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Bernd Schuster's rotation policy has been questioned with the German chopping and changing his team. ""It was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty,"" said Dutch winger Arjen Robben. ""We are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return."" Villarreal, now four points behind Real, lost for only the second time in 15 matches with a 3-2 reverse against Osasuna. Sevilla, third last season, are in a crisis after losing their fourth league game in a row with a goal from Riki handing Deportivo La Coruna a surprise 1-0 win. Sevilla have just six points from their first six matches and are 13 points behind Real. Levante's Abel Resino became the first Spanish league coach to be sacked this season, after their 3-0 home loss to Real Zaragoza.. The 47-year-old Resino, a former goalkeeper at Atletico Madrid, joined Levante in January as a replacement for Juan Ramon Lopez Caro. The Valencia-based club are bottom of the table with only a point from seven matches.",0

Now we're going to roll our chicken in that egg, get it nice and sticky, roll that in the bread crumbs, and let it sit in the fryer until it-"" ""Sorry to interrupt."" A tall man in a fedora and a trenchcoat walked on to the set, drawing a pistol from his pocket. ""I'm sure you know what I'm here for."" ""God dammit. Okay, cut to commercial."" A short, fat little woman with a Bostonian accent walked up to the fake kitchen counter, touting one of those fake paper megaphones that served little purpose other than to make her feel important. ""What's the big idea?"" ""It's a random lottery, ma'am. I'm afraid Chef Charlie has been selected for death."" Trenchcoat shrugged apologetically. ""Interfering with an Angel's duty is a felony offense."" ""It's fine. Come with me,"" Chef Charlie, who had remained surprisingly calm during the entire thing, led the Angel to his dressing room.

This isn't something to joke about."" A bead of sweat trickled down Trenchcoat's forehead. The room was stuffy. Way too warm for a trenchcoat.

"Summary: David Trezeguet omitted from France squad to play Morocco and the Ukraine. The Juventus striker last played for his country in the 1-0 defeat by Scotland. He was dropped for the wins against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. Article: France coach Raymond Domenech has again omitted striker David Trezeguet from his squad for this month's friendly against Morocco and the Euro 2008 qualifier against the Ukraine. Happier times: David Trezeguet celebrates after scoring for Juventus against Torino. Trezeguet has scored scored 10 goals in 11 Serie A matches for Juventus this season -- including two hat-tricks -- but has failed to win his way back into the 24-man party. The 29-year-old, who last played for France in the 1-0 home defeat by Scotland in September, was furious after being dropped for the games against Lithuania and the Faroe Islands. He played no part as Domenech's team overtook the Scots at the top of Group B with comfortable victories last month. The coach said: ""David is having a great start to the season with Juventus, but he's in competition for a place. If we qualify, the Euro 2008 will be in eight months. A lot of things can happen in between. ""I hope David will help Juventus win the Italian league title and that he will be at the Euro 2008 with us, and that he will find his form again for France."" Domenech has again included young Lyon forward Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his debut as a substitute against the Faroes and scored the final goal in a 6-0 victory. Ben Arfa is joined in the squad by club-mate Karim Benzema, while Bolton's Nicholas Anelka is also among the forwards named despite still recovering from an injury. Captain Patrick Vieira is ruled out due to injury, but the Inter Milan midfielder will join up with the squad anyway. ""A player of Patrick's dimension is going to be missed, but we just have to accept it and get on with it. Pat should be coming to see us because he's a leader, and he's the captain,"" Domenech added. France face the Moroccans on November 16 and then travel to the Ukraine on November 21. Domenech's team will qualify for the finals if Italy beat Scotland at Hampden on November 17. If the Glasgow game ends in a draw, France will need at least a point in Kiev to book their ticket. France squad: Goalkeepers: M Landreau (Paris St Germain), S Frey (Fiorentina), U Rame (Bordeaux).

"Prompt: You are a teenager with the ability to measure how `` Dangerous '' people are on a scale from 1 to 10 just by looking at them. A normal child would be a 1, while a trained man with an assault rifle might be a 7. Today, you notice the unassuming new kid at school measures a 10. Story: I've always seen the numbers. Or, at least I've seen them for as long as I can remember. Random numbers, single digits at chest level on every person I've ever met. I see them in pictures, and in movies, on TV and in person. The only time I don't see them is when it's a picture of some long dead guy in a history book. The numbers change all the time. Sometimes my friend has a 1, and suddenly it'll be a 4. People in cars usually have higher numbers but those will move around too. I tried for years to figure out what the numbers mean but they don't have a pattern.

Question: Treatment of contralateral hydrocele in neonatal testicular torsion: Is less more? Answer: We have demonstrated that approaching a contralateral hydrocele in cases of neonatal testicular torsion solely through a scrotal incision is safe and effective. Inguinal exploration was not performed in our study and our long-term results demonstrate that such an approach would have brought no additional benefit. In avoiding an inguinal approach we did not subject our patients to unnecessary risk of testicular or vasal injury. Contralateral hydrocele is commonly seen in cases of neonatal testicular torsion. In our experience this is a condition of minimal clinical significance and does not warrant formal inguinal exploration for treatment. This conservative management strategy minimizes the potential of contralateral spermatic cord injury in the neonate. The aims of the study were met.,0
"Prompt: the monster in the closet finally lures the child into the darkness, only to realize something is very very wrong Story: I hate darkness now, but it wasn't always like this. Not by a long chalk. I remember when I ruled the night! I was an emotional vampire, drinking the fear of others and gaining vitality from their terror. I ventured into the black with impunity, and the sight of me was enough to cause grown men to wet themselves and cry for their parents. Back in those days, the God-botherers did most of my work for me. All I had to do was turn up. Now I'm trapped in a closet, too weak to escape. I can feel myself shrinking, fading, turning into nothing more than a vague memory. And it's all because of little Sybil Terpsichore. I should have known that it was a mistake to come here. To be honest, things had been getting progressively more difficult out there, ever since those accursed computers became widespread. It was bad enough in the 1980s, when the movie industry began raiding the collective unconscious for symbols of primal fear to turn into popcorn movies for teens. They stole our gimmicks and turned them into ironic jokes, and left us with nothing. Many of us faded away, and those that survived only did so because they focused on more vulnerable targets: children and the elderly. I picked the kids, because I figured that their fear is more fundamental, and they are easier to manipulate. Until Sybil Terpsichore, I used to still be able to hear a couple of my colleagues who went the other way. They haunted the airwaves with their polemics on immigration, terrorists, FEMA camps and the like, and scare the bejeezus out of the less discerning oldies. I wonder if any of them are still out there. I had been getting the brush-off from so many kids, dehumanised by open access to the kind of horrors that humanity inflicts on one another - far more bone-chilling than anything we might dream up - and I thought that finding some remote location, off the grid, might dig up some suitably sheltered souls to freak out. Hence this farmhouse, and the Terpsichores. Margaret and Howard Terpsichore moved in to this ramshackle old place in 2004 after Margaret's father passed on and left it to her in his will. They got to grips with managing the sizable plot of land that came with the property, and they soon had a child, Sybil. When I arrived, I was drawn by Sybil's reedy little voice from her bedroom window, singing some kind of nursery rhyme probably sung to her by her mother. Paydirt! I waited until she slept, and took up residence in the closet amongst her toys. She didn't appear to be having any nightmares, which was surprising to me. My aura tended to induce them back in the old days, which was always good for a bit of latent fear to snack on. I was hungry, but I could wait. I needed to get to know her, find out the best way to approach and maximize the effect. That morning, I followed her around the house. She made herself some breakfast and went outside to run around in the cornfield. I wondered if she was just independent for her age, or if she just had lazy parents? I thought it best to investigate further. Bad idea. I entered the master bedroom and found Margaret first, then Howard. Both were long dead - Margaret had been poisoned, apparently by Howard. Howard was less intact, having been shot in the face, then mutilated. I couldn't move without finding a new bit of Howard. ""What are you doing here?"" It was Sybil. She must had been watching me for the last few minutes. ""FEAR ME LITTLE GIRL! I AM YOUR worst nightm-"" ""No you're not. You are my new friend!"" She offered me nothing, not fear, not anxiety, not even a little nervousness. I began to get afraid now. ""I AM NOBODY'S FRIEND! I RULE THE NIGHT!"" My voice was too shrill. ""Well, it's not dark yet"", Sybil responded flatly. ""Come back and try again later."" And that was that. I slunk off into the closet, utterly defeated, too weak to flee elsewhere. Sybil went downstairs to make herself some more food, and I waited for her to go to bed, even though I knew it was futile. I tried, did all the big voice and the gruesome shapes. She just giggled and called me ""silly"". I, who had actually caused kings to die of fright, was now ""silly"". I gave up at that point. Now I lie here, frightened and alone. Irony.",0
"Prompt: Write a story that ends with a phrase `` I was wrong '' and this phrase explains everything Story: We watched the ships land with hope in our hearts. The priests sang out, ""Our saviors are finally here"". The scholars proclaimed that a new age was about to begin- an age of peace and understanding. The poor ran out to the sea with simple gifts of flowers and fruit. Some went so far as to leap into the ocean and swim out to greet the gods. Their white sails seemed to reach into the clouds, their pale skin confirmed their divinity. We welcomed them into our lands, and at first they seemed pleased by the gifts and adulation that we heaped upon them. We, in turn, saw their approval as proof that the signs were correct- the gods had indeed come. But these were not gods, they were men; and they had the same desires, the same faults, the same problems, that make even the best of men turn into beasts. I don't know what caused the problem, perhaps it was always meant to be. They raised their weapons of destruction and released their terrible fury upon those devoted to their glory. The air itself seemed to erupt in thunder, smoke bellowed out like the putrid breath of a thousand volcanos. We could smell the acrid sulfur all around us as the screaming began. Our warriors were cut down, our weapons of stone and wood held no threat to these mighty beings from beyond the sea. Those who could run made their way into the safety of the forest. Everyone else was killed where they stood. We thought they came to save us. We thought they were gods. We thought Quetzaquatal had returned. we were wrong.",0
"Summary: Yuvraj Singh becomes first player to hit six sixes in an over in Twenty20 game. Singh hits 58 in 16 deliveries as India beat England by 18 runs in Durban. England already eliminated from World Twenty20 after South Africa beat NZ. Article: India's Yuvraj Singh smashed six sixes in one over as England crashed out of cricket's World Twenty20 tournament in South Africa on Wednesday. Yuvraj Singh smashes his sixth successive six off England fast bowler Stuart Broad. Paul Collingwood's side were eliminated at the Super Eights stage after South Africa earlier beat New Zealand by six wickets in Durban. England then lost by 18 runs to the Singh-inspired Indians, who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of Thursday's must-win clash with the hosts. Singh reached the fastest 50 in Twenty20 history, needing just 12 deliveries, as India made 218-4. The left-hander's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by Stuart Broad made him the first player to do so in Twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket. South Africa's Herschelle Gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over World Cup in the West Indies earlier this year, while Sir Garfield Sobers and Ravi Shastri achieved it in first-class matches. Singh's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from Andrew Flintoff to captain Collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over, in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once. Virender Sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls, putting on 136 for the first wicket with Gautam Gambhir, who hit 58 off 41 deliveries. Broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs, while fellow seamer Chris Tremlett took 2-45. In reply, England battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs. Opener Vikram Solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls, and Kevin Pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries, but no-one could match the fireworks provided by Singh. Left-arm seamer Irfan Pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs, while Rudra Pratap Singh took 2-28. If India can beat South Africa, it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through. The Proteas have two wins from two Group E outings after beating New Zealand, who have completed their Super Eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat. South Africa restricted the Black Caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on Wednesday, then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as Justin Kemp made an unbeaten 89. Kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical Mark Gillespie for the winning runs. He belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings, having come to the crease in the fourth over with South Africa reeling at 17-2. Kemp added 28 in four overs with Gibbs (19) before putting on another 65 in eight overs with Mark Boucher. Boucher departed for 23, caught by wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum off Gillespie, who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs. The experienced Shaun Pollock then joined Kemp, and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the Proteas to their second victory. The in-form Craig McMillan top-scored for the Kiwis, hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in Tuesday's five-run win against England. McCullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with Lou Vincent, scoring 38 before becoming the first of Morne Morkel's four victims. Morkel, who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs, then removed Ross Taylor (1) two runs later and later bowled the dangerous Jacob Oram for a quickfire 15. He had Shane Bond caught by Boucher, and then almost became the first Twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled Gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire Billy Doctrove.",0
"Summary: India elects first female president, official results show Saturday. Pratibha Patil's supporters are calling victory a boost for women's rights. Bitter election campaign was marked by scandal. 72-year-old Patil was the ruling coalition's nominee for mainly ceremonial post. Article: India has elected its first female president, official results show, in what supporters are calling a boost for the rights of millions of downtrodden women, despite a bitter campaign marked by scandal. Pratibha Patil, 72, is India's first elected female president. Pratibha Patil, the ruling coalition's 72-year-old nominee for the mainly ceremonial post, easily beat opposition-backed challenger and vice president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in a vote by the national parliament and state politicians. ""This a victory of the people,"" Patil told reporters after official results were announced Saturday. ""I am grateful to the people of India and the men and women of India and this is a victory for the principles which our Indian people uphold."" Patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes. There had never been any doubt she would win, given support from the ruling coalition. The governor of the northwestern desert state of Rajasthan, she emerged on the national stage when the Congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate. ""This is a very special moment for us women, and men of course, in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of India,"" Congress party leader Sonia Gandhi, India's most powerful politician, said. Supporters hoped Patil's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in India, like dowry-related violence, into the public spotlight. A woman is murdered, raped or abused every three minutes on average in India. Her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in India, where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations. After the results, Patil supporters took to the streets, singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums. India has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously Sonia Gandhi's mother-in-law, Indira, who was one of the world's first female prime ministers in 1966. But hope Patil's presidency would spark only positive talk about women's influence in India evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities. The employees' union has taken Patil and others to court, claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned. She was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has dismissed accusations against her as ""mud-slinging"", said on Saturday her victory was ""a vote against the politics of divisiveness"". ""All the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered,"" Patil said in a statement last week. Her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well. She managed to offend many minority Muslims, and anger some historians, by saying Indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century Muslim invaders. Then she dismayed modern India by claiming she had experienced a ""divine premonition"" that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru. Critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as Maharashtra's health minister in 1975, saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized.",0

"Summary: AC Milan's Brazilian goalkeeper Dida is suspended by UEFA for two matches. Dida was banned for his over-reacting to being touched by a Celtic supporter. Celtic have been fined $50,800 for allowing the fan to run onto the field of play. Article: Celtic have been fined $50,800 by UEFA and AC Milan's Dida has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the Brazilian goalkeeper in last week's Champions League match at Celtic Park. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in UEFA suspending him for two matches. The incident occurred when the Scottish side beat Milan 2-1 in Glasgow. A fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute, soon after the home side scored their winning goal, and made what appeared to be minimal contact with Dida. The Milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground. He was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced. Dida's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but Celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment, with half of their fine suspended for two years. UEFA did have the power to change the result of the match, although that was always unlikely. UEFA's control and disciplinary body found Celtic guilty of charges of ""lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters"", while Dida was found to have breached UEFA's ""principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". Milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment, which as it stands means he will miss the club's Champions League games against Shakhtar Donetsk. ""It's a suspension that is absolutely excessive,"" said Milan lawyer Leandro Cantamessa. ""It seems to us a very, very unbalanced sentence. It turns Dida into the protagonist of the incident, whereas the protagonist was someone else, and that's not right from a logical point of view."" Celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter, who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month. The club banned the fan for life from all their matches, home and away. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell said: ""As a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome.""",0
"Summary: No bail for ex-NFL star accused of directing men in alleged armed robbery. Simpson faces charges of robbery, assault, burglary and conspiracy. Alleged robbery involved sports-related items, police say. Simpson arrested Sunday in Las Vegas, but he says items were his. Article: Former football star O.J. Simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges, police announced late Sunday. Police released this mug shot of O.J. Simpson after his arrest. Simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a Las Vegas hotel room. Las Vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe Simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the Palace Station Hotel and Casino. Police said Simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia, including some that was unrelated to Simpson, police said. ""We don't believe that anyone was roughed up, but there were firearms involved,"" Lt. Clint Nichols told reporters. Nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims. A reporter asked Nichols: Was ""O.J. was the boss in that room?"" Nichols responded, ""That is what we believe, yes."" Watch Simpson transferred Sunday in handcuffs ». The alleged victims were identified as Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as ""a home invasion-type robbery,"" and Alfred Beardsley, who has been quoted by celebrity Web site TMZ.com as saying that Simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident. Acting on a tip, police met over the weekend at McCarran International Airport with 46-year-old Walter Alexander, of Mesa, Arizona, who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster's information, Capt. James Dillon told reporters. Alexander was arrested Saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon. He was released on his own recognizance and returned to Mesa either Saturday night or early Sunday morning, Dillon said. In addition, investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied Simpson into the hotel room, Nichols said. Nichols said, ""There is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and O.J. Simpson."" Though Simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself, two firearms that police said were used were recovered early Sunday in one of three searches. Investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found. Nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police. ""There is no truth to that whatsoever,"" he said. ""That came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police."" Simpson, 60, has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him, but he has denied that any weapons were involved. ""Whether the property belonged to Mr. Simpson or not is still in debate,"" Nichols said. ""We are still in the process of sorting that out."" Nichols also said that some of the property taken had Simpson's signature. But ""there was some other property taken as well,"" he said. ""I believe there were some Joe Montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff."" The latest charges against Simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution, more than a decade after the June 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ron Goldman. Simpson was acquitted of murder the following year. The trial riveted much of the United States. But in 1997, a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the Goldman family. Simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $33.5 million for the deaths. Goldman had gone to Nicole Simpson's Los Angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings. Goldman's sister, Kim Goldman, said she wasn't surprised by the robbery allegations, since Simpson ""thinks he can do no wrong."" ""He's capable of stabbing people to death, so I think robbery is nothing surprising,"" she said. ""Normal, logical, civil-minded, law-abiding people don't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back."" Fromong had testified on Simpson's behalf in the civil case, telling the court that prices for Simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict. His testimony was part of the defense's contention that Simpson could not afford to pay the Goldmans. Simpson recently wrote a book originally titled ""If I Did It"" and had planned to publish it himself, but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal. A bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the Goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award. The Goldmans retitled the book, ""If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer."" That book just hit bookstores. CNN's Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",0

Yesterday, they'd stripped the whole room- her toys, clothes, games, her whole life packed into a van because mummy and daddy could no longer stand to be in the same room, or even the same city. Oxford would never be a home like Maidstone. Uprooted from her school and torn away from her friends, from the life she knew, the people she loved and trusted- gone, forever. Replaced with uncertainty- unfamiliar faces and unknown streets. *"" Hey, hey, what's all this? ""* Evidently she'd taken too long, sitting on her bed, as the tears rolled down her face. All through the divorce, she'd been detached and distant, trying not to let it affect her, but now that the inevitable moment had arrived, it had all become too much to take. *"" Rugrat, come here.... it'll be alright. ""* That special nickname her father had given her put a flicker of a smile on her face, despite her tears, as he pulled in for the kind of hug she knew she'd miss the most. *"" One day, you'll understand- you'll look back and realise this was what's best for everyone- for mummy, for you, and for me. Understand that I love you, and so does mummy, and that no matter if you're in Oxford or in Maidstone or on the moon, that doesn't change one little bit. There's a whole world of opportunity and possibility out there, Sally, and whatever you do, wherever you go, we'll always be right there with you. ""*",0
"Summary: Venezuelan government hikes taxes on alcohol and cigarettes Monday. Ten percent price increase on alcohol and 20 percent increase on cigarettes. Stores near schools, churches and cultural centers cannot sell alcohol. Chavez plans to increase taxes on luxury goods, including Hummers. Article: The price of sin rose Monday in Venezuela where President Hugo Chavez is on a campaign to make Venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking. ""Everyone's shocked,"" said Leonora Marino, owner of Bodegon Marino in Valencia, Venezuela, west of Caracas. On Monday evening, she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained, she told a reporter. Alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier. ""Really, it's difficult to buy at these prices,"" she said, then joked, ""They say they're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking."" The Venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social, economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking, said Jose Vielma Mora, superintendent of Seniat, the government body that oversees the collection of taxes. Taxes on whiskey, brandy, cognac and other drinks that don't come from cane sugar have been raised $1.79 (3,838 bolivares) per liter, the government-run Bolivarian News Agency said. ""It's unfair because, in the end, the consumer is the one who pays,"" said Fernando Fernandez, a liquor exporter. Chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people, not for revolutionaries. ""We cannot be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey,"" he said. The moves represent the first steps toward transforming each Venezuelan into what Chavez calls ""the new man."" Chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life. In April, Chavez told a graduating class of medical students in Caracas, Venezuela, that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed, according to an ABN report. ""The vice causes much harm, not only to individuals, but to the collective health of the nation,"" said Chavez, who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence. For his part, he has said he drinks too much coffee. Also effective Monday, stores near schools, churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol. Taxes on cigarette imports have also increased, from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price. On the street, some people said they don't understand the motivations for the increase, but predicted their consumption would not change. ""The Venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking,"" said one person. Chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as Hummers, which are imported privately and at great expense. There is no Hummer dealership in the country. Higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich Venezuela. Last year, car sales increased by about 70 percent, according to the CIA World Factbook. But Chavez, who was in Cuba on Monday visiting communist leader Fidel Castro, said he wants to focus less on material goals for Venezuela's 27 million people, 38 percent of whom live in poverty.

"Summary: Julia Vakulenko has reached her first final on the WTA Tour at Bell Challenge. The Ukrainian third seed will face Lindsay Davenport after beating Julie Ditty. Former world No. 1 Davenport defeated Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva. Article: Third seed Julia Vakulenko will face comeback queen Lindsay Davenport in her first WTA Tour final at the Bell Challenge on Sunday. Julia Vakulenko will seek her first victory on the WTA Tour at the Bell Challenge in Quebec. The Ukrainian battled through with a 6-1 4-6 7-5 victory over American qualifier Julie Ditty in the semifinals. The 24-year-old, who reached the fourth round of the U.S. Open, had previously twice lost at the last-four stage this year in Las Vegas and Berlin. She reached a career high of 33rd in the world rankings back in May, but is now 36th. ""Sometimes you play your best and win easy, but sometimes you don't play your best and really have to fight hard,"" said Vakulenko, who squandered points for 5-3 leads in both the second and third sets. ""I'm just going to try my best -- I've never played her and I'm looking forward to it."" Former world No. 1 Davenport is seeking her second win in three tournaments since returning from a one-year hiatus to have a baby. The 31-year-old, who is unseeded after accepting a wild-card to enter the Canadian tournament for the first time, also had to battle to beat Russian second seed Vera Zvonareva 6-2 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 in the semifinals. The three-time Grand Slam winner has surged back up the rankings from 234th to 126th after winning her comeback tournament in Bali and then reaching the last four in Beijing. The American has now beaten Zvonareva in all six encounters between the two players. ""I played well in the first set and had some chances early in the second set, but I didn't quite capitalize on them. I was able to come back but at 4-4 and 5-5 I just didn't return well enough,"" Davenport said. ""I was happy I was able to regroup in the third set. Physically I feel good. There are lots of positives I can take from it, especially beating a really good player and now being in the final. ""I want to be the one on the offensive and not the defensive, and that's what I'm going to try to do. ""I was trying to watch the first semifinal and see if that helped, but I play so much differently than Julie Ditty that it was hard to get anything from it.""",0
"Summary: Two bombs explode in Algerian capital near government and U.N. buildings. Algeria blames group linked to al Qaeda. Official death toll is 26, but some sources say as high as 76. U.N. officials say five of its staff killed and 14 missing. Article: Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with ""no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives."" The group called the operation ""another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France."" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. ""Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,"" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview. He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. ""It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,"" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called ""an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner."" ""The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,"" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. ""I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,"" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence.",0
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: Awesome prompt! I usually find prompts boring but this one was very interesting and had a lot of potential, so thankyou for posting this. One disclaimer I wrote this from my phone. I proofread very carefully but I always miss something so don't kill me guys, autocorrect sucks. Also words like dont and didnt where there should be an apostrophe dont always have an apostrophe because as I said, auto correct on my phone is literally braindead. End of my disclaimer, the story's below, thanks for reading btw, I hope you enjoy! Thoughts raced through my mind with the speed of a concord jet as I contemplated how I was still alive. The fall must have been at least ten stories, and I couldn't feel anything from the waist down. The panic of a man crippled racked my brain. If I survived, would I be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life? Would I ever be able to make love to my wife again? Would I be a broken handicap, scootering about in a chair, unable to use the bathroom without aid, unable to walk or enjoy the out doors? Would I be able to work or drive my old dodge challenger or mow my lawn or walk my dog? Would I have to use one of those vans with the ramps? Would I need to go on disability? What would my life look like from the seat of a chair? That was assuming I would even survive long enough to see rescue. My life was no certain prospect. Even though my heart still pumped, my body bled from just about everywhere it could. My nose and ears ran with crimson and I could taste iron in my throat, and from my abdomen raged a burning pain from what I could only assume were broken ribs. Even though I had survived the fall, my injuries could still kill me, and even if they didn't, the elements, time and wild animals could. As I lay at the base of the cliff from which I had fallen, unable to look at my mangled legs out of fear, a loud SNAP came from beneath my waist, followed by a series of mechanical creaks accompanied by what could only be described as the noise of small electric motors. ""I must be hallucinating, my brain must be hemorrhaging"" I thought to myself, my panic intensifying with every moment, my lungs expanding and contracting at rapid pace as I hyperventilated in shock and confusion. My predicament impacted me more with each moment as thoughts of a dying man rushed through my synapses. The faces of my children, clear as the sky above, appeared to me, their smiles and the sounds of their laughter filling my heart with sorrow as I damned myself, convinced that I would never see them again. As my vision turned blotty from hypoxia, panic and indescribable pain, I turned my eyes down to my legs, my expectation one of blood and jutted bone, but what my eyes landed upon only furthered my desent into panic as I finally slipped into the easing embrace of unconsciousness. By the time I awoke the night was dark, daylight long since faded. The state park I had been climbing in was miles from civilization and all that provided light was the crescent moon and gleaming stars which dotted the clear sky. What glistened from above was beautiful, but I had little appreciation for the esoteric view I enjoyed as the weight of my situation collapsed upon me once more, filling my heart with darkness and pain. For a few moments I hesitated to look down at my legs, but I needed to know. What was it I had seen when I had fallen? Was it some sick hallucination, or could it be true, and if so, how could it possibly be? After gathering the courage to do so, my eyes turned downward once more, this time prepared for whatever they would see, and in the moonlight I could make them out. My legs, ripped and ruined, were that of a machine, the bone replaced by steel, the muscle replaced by pistons and hydraulics, the nerves replaced by wire. Before panic set in once more I composed myself, and using my arms I propped myself into a sitting position, turning analytical eyes towards my bionic legs, trying desperately to figure out what was going on, and what I was and how this could be possible. As I ran eyes and hands over my metal legs with morbid curiosity, a set of voices came from the underbrush to my left. Perhaps they were hikers who had stayed out too late, or better yet a park ranger. Someone, anyone, who could help me reach civilization and a hospital to bandage my bleeding head and set my broken ribs. I knew I would face tough questions, but it didn't matter, my desperation overpowered my fear of judgement and I called out to the people in the dark, yelling for help, my voice hoarse and weak. For a moment the voices subsided, and I cursed myself once more. Had my mind played tricks on me? Had blood loss and dehydration caused me to hear what wasn't. Before I could convince myself that such was the case, a group of five men emerged from the underbrush. They approached me slowly, their silhouettes obscured by darkness, their arms outstretched, holding automatic rifles. One by one the men activated laser sights on their weapons, grouping them over my chest, causing my heart to skip with fear. The five men advanced towards me in tight confident strides, stopping several paces in front of where I sat to a raised fist given by the lead man in the center. The apparent leader of the five lowered his weapon, slinging it over his back, stepping towards me with menace in his gait, signaling his other men to fan out in a semi circle around me, each one careful to maintain their aim upon the center of my mass as they took their positions. ""You dont know me, but we have history Sigma"" said the lead man, stepping in close and kneeling in front of me, his scarred and rough face now visible to me in the low light of the moon. ""Who..... who are you?"" I asked weakly, my words cracking with dehydration, my mind racing, wondering why the man had called me by greek designation. ""I'm Omega, these boys with me are Delta, Gamma, Theta and Omicron. Don't be worried, we wont hurt you unless you give us a reason"" he said, his words low and gruff, violent intent bubbling under the surface of his statement. ""Look man, I need a doctor, please just get me a doctor"" I said, my voice pleeding and pathetic. ""Doc at the farm will have you patched quick"" said Omega. ""The fuck is the farm"" I asked, my words short with annoyance at the coyness of the man. ""Look down at them legs and tell me you're a just a family man from Texas"" said Omega amused, his men laughing at the sarcastic quip. ""What am I?"" I asked meekly, my curiosity overpowering my desire to curse the man for his obscure words. ""You're one of us, and you've been off the grid for too long"" said Omega in reply. ""You..... you're like me?"" I muttered, the worry and confusion thick in my tone. ""He really don't remember shit"" chuckled one of the four flanking Omega, his words condescending and dry. ""Enough talking"" muttered the lead man as he reached into one of the small equipment bags on his kevlar vest, withdrawing a large syringe filled with clear liquid, pushing out a small amount to clear the needle before bringing it to my neck. As it pierced my skin, two words echoed through my mind from deep within my subconcious. As strong as a commandment the phrase came to me, and my body railed with energy, activating the servos which governed my robotic body. ""Never again"" I murmered, echoing the thought, grabbing the hand of Omega with crushing vice grip, his eyes widening in shock at my resistance. My world went black once more, yet I was not asleep. As if in a dream I watched myself, looking on in amazement. In my haze I am limber and agile, my strikes pointed and lethal, my strength superhuman, ripping arm from socket, punching holes through kevlar vests, breaking the barrels of rifles with disarming strikes, and casting aside the five men with ease. My violence is pointed and driven, expertly enacted. In my rage I am a god of war, my lethality beyond reproach, my technique masterful and my results efficient and brutal. As the last man falls to the ground I snap back into reality like a whip coming to rest after contracting. For a moment I felt surreal, as if nothing was material, and then I fell back into my body like stone into still lake. My stunned eyes turned to the broken bodies of the cyborg soldiers cast around me. Two lay dead, their heads smashed with rock and pierced with bullet. The other three lay in shambles, their limbs ripped from place, their bodies broken, their eyes defeated and enraged. My shock only deepened as I peered down to my once broken legs with the realization that, somehow, my body was able to heal itself despite it's metallurgic constitution. I turned my gaze from my still healing legs to my bloody and oil slick hands, struggling to come to terms with what I was and what I am. ""I am death itself, I am a weapon, I am the reaper, I am Sigma"" The thoughts hit me like bricks to the temple, but even then I knew my violence was righteous, I knew not why, but I knew none the less, my violence was righteous, my rage justified, my motivations pure. ""We'll find you fucker, we always get the runners"" cursed Omega, his body torn yet still living, his words rough and angry, yet impotent from his place among the dirt. ""Not this one"" I replied, my tone low and violent, the words shaking with adrenaline as I turned from the gritty scene, sprinting into the underbrush with the speed of a gazelle, determined to return home, ready to protect myself and my family from whatever would come next.",0
"Prompt: Humanity has achieved immortality. Due to resource concerns everyone must submit to a council their chosen manner of death at 150. The more amusing the death the longer the council lets you live. Story: Don't bother reading this, it's got a major logical flaw that I didn't realize until the end. I just don't want to throw away what I've written. _____________________________________ ""She's done it. By God, she's beaten us at our own game."" Councilwoman Thursday grinned. ""Oh, that's clever. That's *very* clever."" ""This is serious, Thursay,"" Friday scolded, ""We have to decide a course of action."" ""You know the course of action, Friday,"" said Monday, ""We must give her a seat on the Council."" ""This could mean the *collapse* of the Council."" Thursday rolled her eyes. ""You're being hyperbolic."" ""No, he's not,"" said Saturday, ""This isn't like the last time we added a new member."" Several members of the council quietly chuckled, remembering the man who proposed to be killed in a gladiator style fight-to-the-death in an ice rink against an unending supply of bloodthirsty giraffes. His submission earned him a pardon, and the seat of Sunday on the council. Councilman Tuesday was brooding over the proposal. ""But it isn't really her'death,' per se, that's funny, right?"" Councilman Friday shook his head. ""No. The law dictates that the execution be broadcast to the world for entertainment. She is judged by our prediction of the public's reaction."" Stubborn as always, Tuesday protested. ""Come now, surely she can't dictate the specifications of the broadcast. The condemned can only choose the method of death."" Thursday laughed. ""Oh, I'm sure there's a precedent for it. Secretary, can you check that for us?"" The Secretary nodded. ""She's trying to subvert the rules,"" said Wednesday, ""Just take out the broadcasting bit and give her 50 years."" Friday sighed. ""We can't. Not unless the request is impossible for the Council to arrange."" ""But-"" ""No but's,"" said Monday, ""Fair is fair."" ""But she *cheated*. We can't allow that to go unpunished."" ""Wednesday, finding a loophole isn't cheating."" Thursday chuckled. ""Quite the opposite, it's an expression of supreme admiration for the rules."" The Secretary cleared his throat. ""If it would please the Council..."" Friday gestured for him to continue. ""In the case of Gabriel Marquet, the condemned was executed by having his skull injected with an explosive fluid and then detonated. He requested that it be broadcast in'slow motion,' which the Council interpreted as 50 % speed, and this was granted."" ""Dammit,"" muttered Tuesday. ""What are we supposed to do, then?"" Thursday turned to Sunday. ""Thoughts, Sunny?"" ""I told you not to call me that,"" Sunday said, ""And you all know how much it pains me to say this, but I agree with Thursday. The only solution is to grant her a seat on the Council."" He turned to Wednesday. ""I'm sorry, but we are left with no alternative."" ""Hey, I got no problem with retirement,"" she said, ""What pisses me off is what this girl is doing to get a seat."" Thursday cheerfully sprang out of her seat. ""I move to grant this woman the seat of Wednesday on the Council."" ""Seconded,"" said Monday. Thursday began to take the vote. ""Monday, how do you vote?"" ""Yea."" ""Tuesday, how do you vote?"" ""Nay."" ""Wednesday?"" ""Nay."" ""Thurs- um, Yea."" ""Friday?"" Friday sighed. ""We're going to have to forbid this sort of thing in the future. Yea."" ""Saturday?"" ""Nay."" ""Sunday?"" ""Yea."" ""By a vote of four to three, Elizabeth Navarro will assume the seat of Wednesday on the Council, for her ingenious execution proposal. Secretary?"" The Secretary excused himself to bring in the new member. ""I guess it was inevitable,"" the former Wednesday said, ""I admit, it was pretty clever, if more than a bit underhanded. The method of death was nothing special, but speeding it up and playing Yakety Sax in the background..."" Thursday nodded. ""If we actually gave her 50 years and then executed her, the broadcast would have warranted an extra 20.""",0

Ants chew my skin. ""No!"" My eyes snap open, taking in the broken sink in the corner. Porcelain jagged, water dripping down the wall. We fixed that. Papers litter the floor, turning translucent like fish scales. ""No, no-"" Fish can be freshwater or saltwater, but we drink freshwater. ""Jess, honey, look at me.""

In that moment, I'm listening to the water bubble in the walls and the gas stream through pipe. Her face hovers over me, aquiline nose sloping up to those stony eyes. ""The sun, Jess.""

"Summary: MME speaks with Sallie Krawcheck, boss of Citi Global Wealth Management. Ranked by Fortune magazine as World's 12th Most Powerful Woman in 2007. Manages client assets worth $1.8 trillion, formerly bank's CFO. Tells MME: ""we're very bullish"" on economic potential of the Middle East. Article: If you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007, consider the pressure of the task when you're dealing with $1.8 trillion of client assets. Sallie Krawcheck has made Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women every year since 2002. That's what Sallie Krawcheck does as Chairman and Chief Executive of Citi Global Wealth Management. She joined the banking industry as a research analyst, but quickly rose through the ranks, gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way. Dubbed the ""Mrs Clean"" of Wall Street, Ms Krawcheck was credited with restoring investors' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm Smith Barney. She joined Citigroup in 2002, and spent some time as Chief Financial Officer before taking up her current role in March 2007. Sallie Krawcheck has been a regular entrant on Fortune's list of the World's Most Powerful Women in Business -- in 2007, she made number 12. John Defterios caught up with Ms Krawcheck in Dubai. He asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the G8 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States). Sallie Krawcheck (SK): I think what's happening right now, it's fascinating because in the United States and in developed Europe we're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis. And in fact, we are awash with liquidity in the Middle East and in Asia as well, so there's really a bifurcation that's occurring in the world. And if you think about, oil doesn't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is; even at levels in the 70's, 60's, 50's, 40's, a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market. Yes, the investments are going up globally, but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region. And so over time, you're really going to see... I think continue to see... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the Middle East as well as to Asia. John Defterios (JD): It's coming almost as a perfect storm; we have a sub prime crisis, a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years. In this window of time, is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of Wall Street and it undermines its role? (SK): I think there is no doubt that New York is losing its status as a financial capital of the world. If you think about some years ago, if you think about the internet bubble for example, where it was New York and California wasn't it? And you look at a whole range of reasons for it, and the sub prime crisis perhaps, the decline of the dollar perhaps. But you have overlapping regulators in the United States, you have very high taxes in the United States, you have a very litigious environment in the United States, and you have the emerging markets coming up, so capital is being raised outside of the United States. These things, some of which are negative for the United States, some of which are positive for the other regions, is accelerating a shift that was underway from New York, to London, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, and potentially to Dubai as well. (JD): Some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both Wall Street and Capitol Hill in Washington. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't say I want some of that liquidity but I only want part of that liquidity. What is the result of that do you think? Can you over-regulate the sovereign funds? (SK): Oh, I think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds. I think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of 'here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity'. And the concern is if, gee these are going to be important going forward, we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets, but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the United States or Europe for example. (JD): It's fascinating because if you look at Qatar or Egypt or Shanghai, the stock markets have almost had like a one way path; there's been some correction here in the Middle East. But what are we likely to see here, stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way, or an implosion because of the rapid gains? (SK): I think you've got to separate the idea of what's going on in the real economies and what's going on in the market places. They move together, but sometimes they separate, they diverge, and they can diverge for a long period of time. If you look at economic growth potential of the Middle East, of Asia, of Latin America, we feel very bullish about this. And I was making the point earlier today, China has been growing at 11 or 12 percent, not for one year or two years, but literally for 30 years. For 30 years it's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see. So, say the same thing for the Middle East, the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant, but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward. (JD): Is Wall Street, or for that matter, London or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case, 1.4 trillion dollars of assets... (SK): 1.8 Thank you... (JD): ...to run one of the major money center banks of the world? I'm sure you're feeling this pressure even though you're young by international standards. Are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank? (SK): Well it looks like the United States may be ready for a woman to take over as President. So I think if we're ready to potentially have a woman run the country, I think we are getting ready as a country, to potentially have a woman run a money center bank. Now, you know, the board wouldn't ask and I wouldn't accept, but if you look across Wall Street, there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are CEO's who move along, and I think it's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country.

"Summary: Congo rebels blame Rwandan Hutus for attack, report says. Internally displaced Congolese flee as rebels attack government troops. Torrential rain makes refugee movement difficult. U.N. refugee agency: Some 375,000 have been forced from homes in past year. Article: Tens of thousands of Congolese refugees fled camps Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of Congo as rebel troops attacked government forces in the area, the U.N. refugee agency said. Refugees move along a road Tuesday in Mugunga, near Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A press release from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said it didn't appear rebels had targeted the camps, but it reported some were looted after camp residents, classified as internally displaced persons, fled. Roads to Goma, about 10 miles from the camps, were crowded with refugees and local residents fleeing the fighting, the UNHCR reported. Torrential rain made the movement even more difficult. ""The main road toward Sake was crowded with people; we had difficulties getting through,"" UNHCR field safety adviser Pierre Nazroo was quoted as saying in the agency's release. ""Internally displaced people are moving from site to site, direction Goma."" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said, ""They have been living in extremely difficult conditions anyway. Now they have nothing but what they can carry."" Redmond added, ""These are people in poor health; they are soaking wet because of the torrential downpours. They need shelter, they need water, they need a lot of assistance so we're going to have to move quickly to get that help to them because a lot of them are already in a weakened state."" While the Congolese government accused troops under rebel general Laurent Nkunda of staging the attack, a Nkunda spokesman denied the allegation, according to a report from the Integrated Regional Information Networks, a U.N.-affiliated news service. The spokesman, Bwambale Kakolele, said Rwandan Hutu rebels who also operate in the area were behind the attack, that report said. A spokesman for the U.N. military mission in the Congo said it was uncertain which group attacked the Congo army outpost near the village of Kishangazi, according to the U.N.-affiliated news service. ""We think it could have been insurgents close to Nkunda who attacked, but we cannot rule out the [Rwandan rebels],"" spokesman Col. Pierre Cherayron was quoted as saying. The UNHCR identified the affected camps as Mugunga I, Mugunga II, Lac Vert and Bulengo, saying about 28,000 had abandoned the first three camps and about 2,000 had left Bulengo. The UNHCR said 375,000 Congolese in North Kivu province have been forced from their homes in the past year. In the past two months alone, 160,000 have fled their homes amid the fighting between renegade troops and government forces, the agency said. North Kivu is in eastern Congo near the borders of Rwanda and Uganda. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has tried to gain a cease-fire with the rebels in the area under Nkunda, but fighting continues as hard-liners among the rebels and in the government have blocked reconciliation efforts, according to the International Crisis Group, an nongovernmental organization looking for solutions to conflicts.",0
"Question: Does either obesity or OSA severity influence the response of autotitrating CPAP machines in very obese subjects? Answer: In this population, neither BMI nor neck circumference nor waist circumference is predictive of autoCPAP pressure. Therefore, the previously derived algorithm does not adequately predict the fixed CPAP pressure for subsequent clinical use in these obese individuals. In addition, some subjects without OSA generated high autoCPAP pressures, and thus, the correlation between OSA severity and autoCPAP pressure was only moderate.",0

"Summary: Study finds opium makes up half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product. Agency pushes NATO forces to attack skyrocketing problem aggressively. Drugs funds insurgency; poppy trade unchecked in Taliban strongholds. U.N. drug chief advocates providing income alternative for poppy farmers. Article: The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy. Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007. The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006. Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said. Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground. The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year. According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade. Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001. ""Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,"" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. ""Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source."" James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade. ""We share the U.N.'s concerns,"" Appathurai told CNN. ""Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation."" He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly. ""The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,"" Appathurai said. Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said. However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked. According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes. Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region. He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors. ""Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,"" the U.N. drug chief said. Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production. ""You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,"" he said.",0

"Summary: Vince McMahon: WWE has one of best drug-testing programs. Wrestling boss tells CNN that individuals bear responsibility for actions. Critics say WWE penalties for drug use are not harsh enough. Wrestlers still can get drugs if they have prescriptions from doctors. Article: The late Chris Benoit idolized the Dynamite Kid, who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying, acrobatic moves. Chris Benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in June. The Dynamite Kid and his partner, Davey Boy Smith, were known as the British Bulldogs. They were quick, agile and muscular, and in 1986 they won the World Wrestling Federation tag team championship. Young Benoit dreamed of wrestling like the Dynamite Kid, whose real name is Tom Billington. At the beginning of his career, Benoit adopted the Dynamite nickname and copied his idol's signature moves. In June, Benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself. Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in Chris Benoit's body, Georgia's chief medical examiner said a month later. When asked about Benoit's double murder-suicide, Billington told CNN, ""It can make you aggressive, the steroids. But personally I wouldn't, you know, kill no bleeding kid, or wife either."" Billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside Manchester, England. He has lost the use of his legs. A pin sticks out from one of his toes. Billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body. And from the steroids, he said. Billington told CNN that the steroids came from doctors, from friends, even from steroids meant for horses. He took them all, took a terrible pounding in the ring, and like his partner (who died at age 39 in 2002), began taking extensive amounts of painkillers. Benoit's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled, now known as World Wrestling Entertainment, and the man who has ruled wrestling for years, Chairman of the Board Vince McMahon. McMahon, appearing with Linda McMahon, his wife and WWE CEO, told CNN: ""Nothing from the WWE, under any set of circumstances had anything to do with Chris Benoit murdering his family. How did we know Chris Benoit would turn into a monster."" Read a full transcript of the McMahons interview. Vince McMahon defended the organization, saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show. ""Our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else's in sport, although again emphasizing we are entertainment, and no one in entertainment, no one has this kind of wellness policy,"" McMahon said. Critics say McMahon pushes his stars and non-stars, works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling. They say McMahon only looks at his employees as commodities, pawns in a huge business. His businesses are quite successful. About 16 million people a week tune into WWE TV shows. Two of their cable programs -- ""Raw"" and ""Friday Night Smackdown"" -- are weekly ratings giants. Pay-per-view specials generate an average of $100 million per year. When asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old, Vince McMahon said each person in the WWE bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena. ""If someone passes through our organization, it is not our responsibility for someone's personal activities,"" he said. He also said there isn't ""any organization in the world, be it entertainment or be it sport, that can tell you that they are totally drug-free."" Watch as a WWE wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong ». The McMahons said the WWE is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes. Since the newest WWE drug screening program began in February 2006, more than 30 of the organization's wrestlers have been suspended, including two since CNN's interview with the McMahons. David Black -- who helped the NFL develop its drug program and now runs tests for the WWE -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning. But Dr. Gary Wadler, a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes, says the WWE is not doing enough. ""It certainly falls far, far short of where it needs to be,"" he said. ""And there is a gold standard, and I measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard. And [the WWE is] miles apart."" Wadler, a longtime critic of McMahon, was referring to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in Colorado Springs, Colorado. U.S. athletes training for the Olympics are randomly tested and, if caught just once, face a two-year suspension from competition. If caught a second time, they can be banned for life. Black's programs test wrestlers four times a year. The first is a ""baseline"" test, according to the WWE. Black then tests for ""nonmedical"" uses, meaning that if an athlete has a prescription, he is cleared. ""It's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program,"" said Travis Tygart, who heads the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. McMahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids. He says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years. Watch one of the new WWE stars talk about being ""straight edge"" ». ""There's an expression in our business, that here is where you make your money. It's your face, it's what you do with it,"" he said. ""It's your personality, it's what you do with it. It's your delivery, your elocution. It's storyline, it's things, all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring."" CNN's Drew Griffin contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Robert A. Singer is accused of e-mailing child porn to 12-year-old girl. 12-year-old girl was actually undercover New York City detective. Singer was identified in court document as National Children's Museum spokesman. Washington museum officials say they are ""horrified"" by the charges. Article: The chief operating officer of the National Children's Museum was arrested Tuesday and is charged with distributing child pornography over the Internet, authorities said. Robert A. Singer is accused of sending images depicting child pornography to people he believed to be a 12-year-old girl and her 33-year-old mother, according to a statement issued by U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia of the Southern District of New York. In reality he was communicating with an undercover detective for the New York Police Department. Some of the pornographic images were sent from Singer's computer at the museum, according to an affidavit filed in support of the charges by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. The Washington museum posted a message on its Web site saying officials there are ""horrified"" by news of Singer's arrest. They reported that he has been suspended from his post, effective immediately, and is barred from the property. Singer, 49, was arrested at his home in Falls Church, Virginia, by federal agents, according to the prosecutors' statement. Authorities allege he engaged in several instant messaging ""chats"" and e-mail communications with the undercover detective, posing as the woman and her daughter, from August to September. He is charged with five counts of distributing child pornography in interstate commerce. If convicted on each count, he would face a sentence of up to 140 years in prison -- up to 20 years for the first count and up to 40 years for each additional count, prosecutors said. Singer allegedly initiated contact with the undercover detective, posing as the mother, in an America On Line chat room called ""Cuties."" The chat room attracts people who ""are known to trade in pornographic images, including child pornography,"" according to an affidavit filed in the case by a special agent who investigates child pornography and child exploitation for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""On five separate occasions in August 2007, Singer sent several images of child pornography over the Internet to the mother and the daughter, including images depicting sexual acts between minors and adults and images depicting known victims of child exploitation,"" prosecutors said. In his communications with the supposed daughter, Singer pretended to be a 15-year-old boy, authorities said. In August 2007, he sent her two images featuring child pornography, according to the affidavit, with the instruction, ""just delete it when you are done."" A search of Singer's AOL account activity showed that from July to September, he sent about 80 images featuring child pornography to people including the detective, authorities said in the statement. Also, the search revealed that he had received about 10 images and one video depicting child pornography. Singer was expected to appear before a U.S. magistrate judge later Tuesday. He is identified in the complaint as a spokesman for the National Children's Museum, but a spokeswoman who asked not to be identified said he was promoted to chief operating officer within the past few months. He has been employed by the museum for four years, she said. In a written statement, the museum said it was notified by the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of Singer's arrest. ""We are horrified by the charges,"" the statement said. ""This news is deeply upsetting to the National Children's Museum family."" ""As its essence, the National Children's Museum is about enriching the lives of children,"" the statement said. ""We are educators, child advocates and parents. Anyone who does anything that might endanger the welfare of a child has no place here. Harming children is against everything we stand for as an organization and as individuals."" The museum, formerly known as the Capital Children's Museum, has been closed to the public since 2004, and operates from administrative offices, the statement said. A new facility is being built and is scheduled to open in 2012.",0
"Summary: If you build it, the tourists will come to your museum. Museums for hobos, medical oddities and trash. Kentucky museum is where dummies go to die. Article: 1. The SPAM® Museum. SPAM marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the Chinese Year of the Pig. If the on-site ""wall of SPAM"" is any indication, a tour through the SPAM Museum in Austin, Minnesota, is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family. SPAM's parent company, Hormel Foods, opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of SPAM. One of the main attractions is a scale model of a SPAM plant, where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce America's favorite tinned meat. 2. National Museum of Funeral History. It's pretty hard to argue with the motto ""Any Day Above Ground is a Good One."" So goes the backhanded optimism of the National Museum of Funeral History, a Houston facility that opened in 1992. Visitors are treated to exhibits that include a Civil War embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory. In addition, the museum boasts an exhibit of ""fantasy coffins"" designed by Ghanaian artist Kane Quaye. These moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken, a Mercedes-Benz, a shallot, and an outboard motor. According to Quaye, his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients, which -- let's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot. 3. The Hobo Museum. If you're bumming around but looking for a good time, be sure to take a load off in Britt, Iowa, at The Hobo Museum, which details the history and culture of tramps. Bear in mind, though, that the museum kind of, well, slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual Hobo Convention. Luckily, tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year. Of course, if you're interested in the Hobo Convention, lodging is available all over the area, but it's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the ""hobo jungle,"" located by the railroad tracks. Both the event and the museum are operated by the Hobo Foundation, which --incidentally -- also oversees the nearby Hobo Cemetery, where those who have ""caught the westbound"" are laid to rest. 4. The Mütter Museum. Originally, the College of Physicians of Philadelphia erected the Mütter Museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena. (You know, babies with two heads, that sort of thing.) But today, it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque. There, you'll find the world's largest colon, removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation. Also on display: an OB-GYN instrument collection, thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens, and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects. 5. The Barnum Museum. What better way to honor ""Greatest Show on Earth"" founder P.T. Barnum than with a mediocre museum in Bridgeport, Connecticut? Some visitors will appreciate the museum's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus. But only circus freaks (and by that we mean ""enthusiasts"") will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of Barnum's 40-inch-tall sidekick, General Tom Thumb. 6. The Conspiracy Museum. There's more than one theory about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well? Most JFK buffs are familiar with the Sixth Floor Museum housed in the former Texas School Book Depository, which recounts all those boring ""mainstream"" details of the late president's life leading up to his death at the hands of Lee Harvey Oswald. But just down the street, the Conspiracy Museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into The Man's propaganda. For the most part, the museum specializes in showings of the Zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories, including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement. 7. The Museum of Questionable Medical Devices. Take two trips to the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices and call us when you've lost all faith in the medical profession. Thanks to curator Bob McCoy (who recently donated the collection to the Science Museum of Minnesota), those in search of history's quack science can find what they're looking for in the St. Paul tourist attraction, whether it's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers. If you make the trip, be sure to check out the 1930s McGregor Rejuvenator. This clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies, sans head, in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process. 8. Cook's Natural Science Museum. What began as a training facility for Cook's Pest Control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest. At Cook's Natural Science Museum in Decatur, Alabama, visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats, cockroaches, mice, spiders, and termites ... all for free. And while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them, museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing Pest of the Month keep reeling in patrons. 9. Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum. So, what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville? The Vent Haven Ventriloquist Museum, of course -- where dummies go to die. The Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, museum was the brainchild of the late William Shakespeare Berger, who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets. In fact, he collected figures from some of the country's most famous ventriloquist acts. And with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling, you're bound to feel like you're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one. But sadly, when Berger gave the tour, you could totally tell his mouth was moving. 10. The Trash Museum. Mom wasn't kidding when she said one man's trash is another man's treasure. At the Trash Museum in Hartford, Connecticut, the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority (CRRA) turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment! T. our the Temple of Trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump. And for your recycler-in-training, head across the state to the Children's Garbage Museum, where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile, get a glimpse of the 1-ton Trash-o-saurus, or enjoy the company of resident compost worms.

"Prompt: You made a deal with the Devil, and now he 's come to collect. Story: Jim Watson was eating an apple when the Devil appeared before him, but he didn't stop. It was juicy with just the right balance of sweet and tangy, a honeycrisp he'd picked up from the Farmer's Market just that morning. The acrid smell marking the presence of the Dark One threatened to sour Jim's enjoyment of his succulent treat, so he put a dishtowel to his face and walked into the dining room. “ Please, just stay in there. I can hear you just fine, ” he said, talking around chewed up apple. A deep purple light beamed from underneath the door, and tendrils of smoke crept out, but the door itself didn't move. The sharp sound of clacking could be heard from the kitchen. Claws. When the Devil spoke, the sound of it should have made Jim's skin crawl; it sounded like the voice of an average, congenial man, the sort of man who would shake your hand with a smile, imitated poorly. “ Jim, buddy. It's done. She's not gon na bother you no more. ” “ Now that don't sound like Sheila, Mr. Satan, ” Jim said. “ You sure we're talking about the same woman? She's got a tendency to just turn up on you. That's the whole reason I had to come to you in the first place. ” “ Oh, don't you worry now, Jim, ” said the Devil. “ You won't be seeing your wife no more. ” “ And you can't bring her back? She's gone? ” “ I said you won't be seeing her again, Jim, and you won't. ” The voice was stern now. Jim gaped his jaw like a snake to gob an extra big bite of apple. He chewed loud and long, sucking out the juice from the tender pulp as he gnashed it between his molars. He nibbled errant bits of peel as it all went down his throat, and then he went for another bite. Jim smacked his lips and dashed to lick the dripping juice from his fingers before it fell to the carpet. He made a scene of eating a damn apple, and the Prince of Lies waited patiently for his reply. Not a claw clacked on the tile as Jim ate; the only sound was the man's gluttonous glee. Jim set the half-eaten apple on the table, and wiped his hands with a napkin. “ Mr. Satan? ” he said. “ Yes, Jim. ” “ How'd you do it? ” “ Oh, Jim. Now, I wouldn't want to tell you that. ” “ And why not? ” “ Well, there are a lot of reasons, really, but think about it. When the police come knocking, and you realize they will, right? ” “ I guess I hadn't thought about it. ” “ You should think about it. Tell me, Jim, when they tell you what they found, do want to fake surprise, or do you want to really be surprised? ” “ That's a good point, Mr. Satan. ” “ Well I'd hate to see someone get what they want and then not be able to enjoy it. ” Jim fingered the apple, rotating it slowly on the surface of the table. “ Mr Satan, I thank you for what you've done, sir, but I think it's time we parted ways. I've got a dinner to cook, and I'm sure, well, I'm sure you're pretty busy yourself. ” “ You could say that. ” “ Well, then. ” “ Jim, ” said the Devil. His voice was a poorer imitation than before. “ Aren't you forgetting something? Jim grinned. “ I don't think so. ” “ Jim, ” said the Devil. The purple light began to pulsate slowly, swirling with midnight blues and bloody reds. “ Your soul belongs to me. ” Jim picked up the apple and took another bite. His mouth full, he shook a finger at the door slowly, saying, “ Now that's where you're wrong, Mr. Satan. Now now, I know I promised you my soul in exchange for your little favor. That's true. But I didn't tell you that I'd already traded my soul away before I ever called you up. ” “ You gave it away, ” said the Devil. Jim hacked off another chunk of apple with his incisors, smacking as loudly as before. “ That's right. My friend Sam and I traded each others' souls about a week ago. I've got his, and he's got mine. I signed that weird paper you showed me, and I know I said I'd give you my soul, but I don't have it. It ain't mine to give any more. But hey, make me an offer and I might be willing to part with Sam's soul. I doubt he'd even miss it. ” “ No thank you. I don't really want it. ” “ Well good bye, Mr. Satan. You're not getting mine. ” “ I'm not? Then what's this? ” There was a crinkle of paper, and then a single sheet slid out from under the kitchen door. It was a note, rumpled slightly, a yellow page from a legal pad handwritten in pen. Jim's heart fell into his stomach. “ That's my– ” “ Contract. ” “ My contract. ” “ Amended. Slightly. ” Jim lost his grip on the apple, and it fell to the floor. “ Sam sold it to you, ” he whispered. “ What did he want? ” “ Your wife. ” “ But you said, you said she was.... ” “ I said you won't be seeing her again, Jim, and you won't. ” The purple light went out. The kitchen door swung open.",0
"Prompt: Tell the origin story of the most awesome or most interesting character you can imagine. Story: I don't know who I am. As my eyes open for seem like the first time, I look around the cave I'm in. How did I get here, I ask myself, before realizing that I can not speak. Alone in my thought. I attempt to take my pulse. Nothing there, somehow. I check my person for any sort of supplies, anything that could help me get out of here. No luck, so I begin to look around my cave. At first glance, it was just an empty room. No way out, at least from what I can see. Panic begins to set in. What if I never get out? Does anyone know where I am? More importantly does anyone know I'm here? I notice that there is a gust from above me. Scaling the side of the wall I find my way above my resting place. A dark passageway stands between me and a possible way out. Trembling with fear of not knowing, I enter the passage. Coming out of the room, I look left and right. Cave in to my right, the way that leads up. Desperate to explore my cell, I begin to head down the path of the cave. I look around the cave to try to find any hints where I am. The biology of the cave doesn't help me. All I can see are generic small bats that attempt to swoop at me as if I am holding a basket of fruit. Eventually I come across what seems like a hut, if you could call it that. The mouth of the hut looked like a sort of animalistic mouth, nearly all black. Thats when I hear what sounds like a person....talking inside. I attempt to scream out to anyone that could be out there, but I remember: I cant talk. Inside the cabin is the source of the voice. A man with unkept hair, surrounded by empty cans and reeked with alcohol lay passed out in the center of the room. I attempt to wake him by pushing and poking him, but he does not give off any sort of reaction except the occasional groan. Left with no other options, I search for something that might help me escape this hell. His ""home"" was entirely empty, except for a few crates scattered around the man, probably alcohol. Luckily enough inside one of the crates is a small pistol. Engraved on it is an etching of the North Star, Polaris. I really didn't enjoy the idea of stealing, but I mad a silent oath to myself that one day I would find this man and return it. I turn around and leave the man behind and try to leave to cave. Back to where I started, I search the cave in once more. Oddly enough, it seems more.... delicate than it did before. Just by shooting it with my gun, which I've appropriately named ""Polar Star"" at this point, I an able to break free farther into the cave. Eager to have possibly found a way out, I take a step into the newly discovered portion of the cave. It was then I realized my mistake. I should have checked my step before I entered this portion. The weakened flooring crumbles as I fall through the floor, and I remember one thing. My name is Quote. Also- this is my first post on this sub so I will take any advice and/or criticism!",0
"Prompt: You 're a successful womanizer and across the room you see a beautiful yet disinterested woman who you must have. Story: Quietly slipping my ring into my pocket, I pushed myself against the ominously large wooden doorway of the newly-opened bar. I found myself exerting more force than I'd anticipated, as though the entrance itself wanted nothing to do with me. That'd make two of us, then - though I didn't pause and consider the meaning of this or anything pretentious like that. I was here for fun, not philosophy. And so, I threw the doorway open and quickly slipped in before it had the chance to shut on me. My eyes had trouble adjusting to the light. It was late, making the contrast between outside and here the same as night and day. A single, bulky television set hung above the bar tables, providing a constant stream of football. ""Monday Night Football"".... then, it was Monday. I'd always had trouble keeping up with dates. They were never really my thing. After a quick glance at the screen I diverted my gaze to the stage. A small band, seemingly local, was providing gentle ambient music to the scene. Was this jazz or country...? I didn't even consider it could be possible for music to be so ambiguous genre-wise. A quick glance was all I needed there as well. I slipped my hand into my pocket and checked my ring, just in case. Of course it was still there, and quickly I'd realized that I'd been standing about at the entrance for a minute or two. I quickly made my way towards the nearest bar counter. ""What'll it be for ya?"" came a voice out of nowhere, even as I sat down. I'd had my eyes on a group of girls towards the stage for a bit and hadn't been paying attention. It was the bartender, of course. A short, stubby little man with a shaved head but by no means a shaved face. I briefly imagined the difficulty he would have drinking from such large mugs without getting his impressively long beard soaked with ale. I almost laughed - what a strange thought. ""Nothin' for me, not yet."" I made sure to say'not yet' so as to avoid being removed from the building. I wouldn't be drinking today, yet I've learned from past experiences to not let anybody involved with the bar know that. Lost me a good catch once that way. Never again. I glanced over in the direction of the little party of cuties hanging out down by the stage. ""But,"" I continued while directing his gaze towards the ladies with my head, ""I'm thinkin' one of those ladies could stand to have a bit more, yeah?"" The bartender - whose nametag, claiming his name to be ""Chuck"", had just caught my eye - tried to cover up a sigh yet failed to do so. Chuck had been mindlessly wiping down the same section of the counter since I'd sat down, clearly expecting something different from myself. Sorry, pal. Can't help myself tonight. My money's just as good as any, though. Chuck gazed over at the girls for far longer than what one would describe as a simple glance. The word ""gaze"" came to mind. Hell, he was looking at them longer than I did. What was he doing? Weighing his options? I couldn't help but lose a little bit of my friendly smile. What's the big deal to you? She's just a girl, and money is money. I'd even pay extra if he resisted. ""They're just here to have some fun, sir,"" he politely noted. ""See the one on the left? Just turned twenty-one today. Came here with her friends on a whim. I wouldn't want to invade on that if I were you, sir."" ""Ah, so, first time to a bar huh? Well, y'know, legally anyways. Quite a looker, that one - I'd say she's no first-timer to bars."" I rambled on, still staring at the lady he'd pointed out to me. She was the one, no doubt. He'd even been nice enough to give me some details on her, though he certainly didn't mean it that way. ""Girl's got a lot goin' for her though, for sure. Looks like a real animal, yeah? Wouldn't even be shocked to hear she could drink more than me! One drink'll do her no harm, I think. Three drinks'd be nice and safe for her, even."" ""Sir, I don't think.... I'm not in any position to tell these things myself. I assure you that the drink itself is not the problem. It's just-"" Words came out of my mouth before he even finished his sentence. ""Eh? No problem, you say? C'mon then, one little drink. I'll pay extra, I will. She'll be nice and safe, won't do any harm to her. She's got all her friends to back her up, too."" I stopped looking at the girls and focused on the bartender, who was shaping up to be my biggest obstacle between me and the girl. Morality is admirable, sure, but what's he think I'm going to do to the girl? Never anything without consent. He followed suit, now looking directly at me, yet still wiping down that same part of the counter. It almost seemed like he was pressing down far harder than he'd been earlier, though it could just be me. After a moment though, and to my utmost surprise, he stopped wiping and placed the rag down. ""Sir,"" he began with a sigh, ""do you know where you are?"" His eyes held no hint of sarcasm or insincerity. Suddenly, the atmosphere became extremely uncomfortable, even for myself. I couldn't help but fidget ever so slightly in my seat. ""I can't say I do, not specifically anyways. Just know it's a bar. That not good enough?"" ""I'm sorry sir, but not quite good enough. I'm Chuck. The owner of this bar, Chuck's Tavern."" He stood up straight now, making him quite a bit taller than me, as I remained seated and heavily slouched against the low counters. ""I don't appreciate people like you coming into my property and treating it like some sort of brothel, you hear me?"" His voice was heavy. Heavy in that it almost made me shake, and heavy in that it was shockingly loud and focused on myself. I glanced quickly over towards the stage to see that what I'd feared had been true - the girls had heard the commotion and had fixed their eyes on myself and Chuck. I shrugged, trying to take control of the situation, but I knew my mission was going south quickly. Mindlessly checking my pockets, I grabbed my ring to ensure it was safe. At least I've still got this, I thought, before swiveling on my stool back to face Chuck. ""Gotcha Chuck, no harm meant here, just wanted to see those girls faces when they'd gotten a gift from a nice stranger like myself, nothin' more, I swear. If ya still think that not true, though, I could settle for a nice drink myself, no need for nothin' more than that. Pay you for your troubles n' all."" As the words flowed gracefully out of my mouth, I felt like the smoothest man to walk the Earth. Towards the back, a few giggles came up - some, I thought, even came from the ladies watching me at the stage. Chuck looked at me in such a way that I swear I'd been interrogated, switching from eye to eye and squinting a little bit more each second. I felt the tension grow, even after I'd attempted to diffuse the situation. I wondered to myself why I didn't just get up and leave at that point. I would imagine that the eternity I felt his eyes on me was not an actual eternity, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was close, though at some point he did lift his heavy gaze off of me and go back to wiping down the counter. Never thought I would've missed seeing him do that. ""Alright, sir. It's not a problem. What'll it be for you?"" he asked, with a hint of a smile that could either be entirely real or entirely fake. ""Get me a Black Velvet, would you?"" I asked as politely as I could. Bringing back Chuck's wrath was something I wasn't ready to do. ""Of course, sir. One moment."" I was glad he knew what I'd ordered. For a moment I considered he may not understand, and might've thought I was trying to make a fool out of him. Despite his strong sense of morality, the guy seems to know what he's doing, I thought. Perhaps we'll even be able to put this behind us, and maybe I'll come back again in the future. Just for drinks, of course. Suddenly, however, the relative silence and tranquility of the post-war bar scene was interrupted by Chuck's yelling voice. ""Sharla! Where'd you put all the damn champagne!?"" I hadn't noticed anybody else working at the bar at that time. There were very few people - in fact, aside from the group of ladies, there may very well have been less than three other individuals present. Turning around in confusion, I searched for this Sharla.... .... when I saw the same lady I'd eyed up earlier speak up. Or, rather, shout. ""Dad, I already told you I'd moved it to the very back of the storage room!"" I may not be the brightest individual, but the moment she began to speak I realized my mistake. The revelation hit me full force. I'd never been punched before, not square in the face, but that's the only comparison I could possibly make. I tried to take home the owner's daughter. ""Thank you, sweetie!"" shouted Chuck back, as he turned to me and announced he'd be right back with my drink. I simply sat there, stunned. It might've just been my imagination, but it seemed like the smile he gave me before leaving to get the goods was one made not of friendliness but of malevolence. He knew I'd embarrassed myself, even if nobody else knew what happened. Well, that's fine. I'll admit I should've seen it coming. The music died down in the bar as the local band left the stage, the last performance of the night. The soft lighting grew dimmer and dimmer to warn customers of the bar's upcoming closing time. Football was over, the single television hanging above the bar counter blinked off. And when Chuck, the family-friendly owner and bartender of the newly opened Chuck's Tavern, returned to deliver my drink.... I had already left, ring in pocket, entirely defeated.",0
"Summary: Some witnesses say Colorado does nothing to protect them. One witness spent over 10,000 dollars on security after being terrorized. Community activist says Colorado's witness protection program is ""a joke"" Article: A Colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $10,000 on a security system, hired a bodyguard for his son's wedding and never leaves home without a .45-caliber handgun strapped to his chest. Keith Reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case. The man, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of Keith Reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family. A report in the Denver Post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of Colorado. Paul Logli, chairman of National District Attorneys Association, told Congress this year that witness intimidation has become ""almost epidemic,"" according to the Denver Post. When asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of Colorado's witness protection program, the witness in the Reynolds case said, ""All they told us was maybe we should move."" ""I'm pretty sure I told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program. I can't remember if I gave them all the details."" the prosecutor assigned to the case, who didn't want to be named, told CNN. After Reynolds' conviction, the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home. They received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked. The couple received a death threat from Reynolds himself through the mail. Watch witness describe fear of being targeted ». Reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation. However, it is likely he'll be released within five years. No national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist, and minimal research has been conducted on the subject. The latest National Institute of Justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem. Colorado has $50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget. In contrast, the city of Denver spent almost $100,000 on landscaping last year. The state, on average, spends about $1,000 per witness. That figure supposedly includes moving expenses, rent, and furniture. The federal program spends in excess of $40 million per year on witness protection. One possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities, as do federal witnesses. ""It's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public's expense; it's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses,"" according to Peter Weir, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Safety. Colorado's witness protection program is a ""joke,"" according to The Rev. Leon Kelly, founder and executive director of the Open Door Youth Gang Alternatives. Kelly says the state doesn't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward. More than a decade ago, a young man named Darryl Givens asked Kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison. Givens chose to testify. A few months later, he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends. That day continues to haunt Kelly. Rhonda Fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son's murder. Javad Fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married. He had plans to move east when a Fourth of July barbecue in 2004 in changed all that. He witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing. Javad Fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in Aurora, Colorado. The couple, both 22, died instantly. Rhonda Fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program. She confronted prosecutors after his murder. Fields told CNN, ""I asked them what happened. Why weren't any measures taken to safeguard his life? And I was told he never asked for any protection."" Javad's mother does not think it was her son's responsibility to ask for protection. ""I think it's the authorities' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness,"" she said. Field's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program. Prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting Javad Fields' personal information be kept secret, but it wasn't signed by a judge until one year later, after defense lawyers had already given the suspects Fields' personal information, along with crucial trial documents. ""I felt like the DA's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life,"" Rhonda Fields told CNN. District Attorney Carol Chambers maintains the program has improved. She says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena, ensuring witnesses are aware of their options. That didn't start, however, until two years after Javad Fields was killed.",0

"Prompt: `` Watch out or you 'll end up like Alice. '' Story: When Lance got into Dartmouth I knew he was up to something. Adderol, blood doping, testosterone supplements, tren. All of these can explain sudden bursts of exemplary behavior, a swift kick in the pants sending a person flying through the realm of desperation and landing them further right on the ol' bell curve. But this I couldn't believe. Lance, whose dorm walls were crisp white, unadorned. Tie was always tied just tight enough, no shirttails loose or threads pulled on his sweater vest. Even during casual weekends, unsurveyed by the authority as it exists in our little school, enjoying darts and billiards in the common room his polo was tucked in crisply to his khakis. There wasn't a rebellious, forward thinking bone in his body. From the deep fires of my revolutionary spirit I knew him to be an enemy, despite the fact that I never heard a strong opinion (pro or anti-authority) from him. At least that's how it started, I saw the Sophomores a year above me start to beef up their applications in December. The institution attracted all kinds of outliers, our lacrosse and academic decathlon teams were undefeated and shared many of the same members, but Lance was not one of the elite few who we all knew would be singled out by the all-powerful Ivy League admissions committees and raised to the heavens of society among the other angels, transcending us mortals' petty competition. I didn't notice when a few of the girls from across the way started lingering outside of the practice field where he played (mediocre) for the soccer team. I didn't see when our math and philosophy professors started smiling, really smiling, when he raised his hand in class. I didn't notice when he was walking with Principle Mikkels, both smiling and laughing, Lance trailing his hand along the fence. He was selecting leaves of ivy from the frame and then forsaking them, dropping them back to earth. I did notice when I was returning from one of my late-night secret trysts with my small pipe and tiny bag of weed. I'd discovered an unpatrolled hallway which led back to just near enough to the dorm doors to make a run for it. The hall trailed along the outside of the West wing, not much was done over here but pieces of art by students were displayed. I normally ignored them in part because they were derivative trash, obviously shat out by some apathetic student on the complacent understanding that any effort at all would guarantee an A, another four points towards the grade point average and the satisfaction of a fine arts graduation requirement. Then I saw it, simple canvas and oil paints. The thing was damn beautiful guys, I don't think any description would do it justice. Just go check it out, it's still up in the hallway. Look at the name at the bottom right and tell me what you see. Actually, fuck it. You know. It's Lance. I started looking at some of his work in other courses, philosophy and math, and I was impressed with the elegance of his arguments, it seemed like he knew much more than the question asked him to and he toyed with each of them, giving them hints through his answers to their simple questions of the much larger questions they should (could) be asking. Acceptances rolled around about a year later and wouldn't you know it but good ol' Lance got a fat parcel in the mail from Dartmouth. I knew the kid's GPA and his SAT and they were much less than outstanding. He sucked at soccer. I truly, honestly believe he got in on the sheer merit of his personal statement and letters of rec. Shit you not, up until that point I wasn't even sure they read those. I had to figure out what was going on. I know it's desperate but I followed him on one of the town trips. He took a few back ways, maybe trying to lose a tail or maybe just rehearsing the convoluted wanderings during which at some point he discovered his destination Eventually he turned into an old shop, a tattered sign the door read ""The rabbit's hole."" Not an adult emporium surprisingly, but close. An old head shop. Looking through the dusty window I saw him trade a wad of bills with an old ponytailed hippy (dressed like some kind of steampunk nobleman, pocketwatches are so lame) for a sheet of what looked like those sugar buttons on thin receipt paper that were popular back in elementary school. I hung around the corner so I could see what he did on the way out, but wouldn't you know it, he turned right into me. I could tell looking into his eyes that he knew I knew. So I guess I knew he knew I knew. Whatever. I asked him very nicely to explain and he seemed more than willing, lead me to a park a few blocks north where the old growth trees and weeping willows turned the sunny day into twilight, ignoring the high noon hour. There gathered there a few of the kids from our school, a few of the girls from across the way, and some townies. They all looked so goddamn happy. They laughed and flirted and ran like little kids, just aimless chase. No rules tag. Tagbacks abound. They explained they'd been buying this stuff, ""like LSD but not at all,"" from the old hippy in the rabbits' hole. They'd been doing it for about a year now, discovered the place entirely on accident while hanging out after a soccer tourney in the town. They offered me a tab. ""Is this stuff risky?"" I asked, I mean I experiment but you know I don't know what the hell it was. ""Not at all. Just.... don't take too much. The creativity can be addicting and if you OD- well I guess not OD but take too much at once, get greedy, it can go bad."" Lance responded to me. ""Watch out, or you'll end up like Alice."" He gestured to the edge of a park where (I can't believe I didn't notice before) It looked like a beautiful blonde girl in her prep school uniform was grinning and laughing, smiling at the trees. ""She's been like this for about a week now, she keeps talking about all sorts of weird shit. Growing bigger and smaller, disappearing cats. We tried to keep it secret but that's hard when you're tripping twenty-four-seven, you know? Teachers noticed. It's bad, her folks are going to get her in a psychiatric camp somewhere in the West once they get back from Fire Island. She won't snitch on us though."" I stared hard at her strange posture and face, grin as big as you please, eyes wide. She babbled like a toddler. I turned back to Lance, his smile of a similar quality but lesser magnitude. ""Definitely not gon na happen to you. You want some?"" What did I choose? Well I think the fact that I'm fucking stalling on my degree in community college right now, working part time at the stupid grocery store as a bag boy should tell you the answer. If I could go back I'd take that tab in a heartbeat.",0
"Prompt: Imprisonement sentences are carried out by putting the condemned in stasis. While under, they experience the full lenght of the sentence, alone. To the outside world, only 12 seconds elapses. Story: The gavel hit the wood, and the noise echoed through the courtroom. ""Guilty,"" the judge said. ""N-no! Please don't take me away! I didn't do it! Honestly! Why would I kill her and chop her into pieces?! I loved her! I'm the most devastated person here!"" Carl shouted in protest. The judge looked down on him. ""All evidence points in your direction."" ""What does that have to do with it?! How do you know the evidence wasn't fake?!"" The prosecution sighed. ""That's the fifth time you've said that through this case. Serve your sentence and regret your sins."" Carl turned towards the audience seats. ""Boss! You don't think I would do it, right?! You know how much I love her!"" The tall bespectacled man looked down on him. ""You mean loved. I would fire you if I could, but sadly I can't. See you tomorrow."" Carl's fists were clenched tight, and he didn't move until he was escorted out of the building. After an hour of being escorted, he was led into a two-story facility. The lobby looked like that of a hospital, he was directed into a room the size of a bathroom. The only thing in the room were a cylindrical machine the size of an adult. Carl was put into the machine, and got some cables connected to his body. After the cylinder was closed, Carl saw only darkness. *Commencing punishment. Criminal: Carl Sagen.

I knew you were alive! * A girl called Pernille entered the living room, but stopped once she saw Carl. ""Umm, why are you carrying a knife and a saw?"" ""Don't worry about it. A coworker needed some space in his shed, so she asked if I could keep these over the weekend,"" he said, before showing a smile. ""Can I get a hug?"" Pernille ran up to him and embraced him. *I really love you Pernille. * Carl realized something was wrong. There was something that shouldn't be there. Pernille's back had a knife sticking out of it. And his own hand gripped the handle. He heard a coughing sound from below him. He looked down, and saw the body embracing him sink to the ground. His shirt was covered in blood. *Now we'll be together forever! * Took the knife to his mouth, and licked the blood off it. ""Hey, if we're always going to be forever, you should do it properly. Cut me up, and eat me piece for piece instead."" Carl looked up, and saw Pernille's silhouette. ""Of course!"" He then cut the body into pieces, before he started to eat them. 15 minutes later the door was kicked open. A neighbor had called the police because he had heard weird sounds from the apartment. As Carl was brought away, his vision slowly turned black. *Continuing punishment. Criminal: Carl Sagen. Crime: First degree murder and desecration of victims body.

A girl's voice called out to him. ""You're finally home! I've missed you these last ten years."" Carl moved forward, and hugged the silhouette running up to him. ***** I feel that the end got pretty rushed, mostly because I was not in the mood for writing, but I still wanted to finish it.

"Summary: Atletico Madrid bounce back to form with a superb 4-0 victory over Zaragoza. Maxi Rodriguez scores twice with Luis Garcia and Diego Forlan also on target. Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Murcia. Article: Atletico Madrid recovered from their painful recent defeat by Barcelona to crush European rivals Real Zaragoza 4-0 in the Primera Liga on Sunday. Luis Garcia celebrates his first Atletico Madrid goal in their superb 4-0 victory over Real Zaragoza. Luis Garcia's first goal for the club, a double from Argentine Maxi Rodriguez and a Diego Forlan strike clinched a comfortable win as Atletico moved up to sixth in the table. It was also sweet revenge for Atletico as Zaragoza beat them home and away last season to beat them to sixth place and the final UEFA Cup spot. Atletico went ahead in the 10th minute when Forlan picked out a precise pass for Garcia who made no mistake with a calm side-footed finish. Forlan then got on the scoresheet himself with a first-time lob on 34 minutes for his third goal of the season, before Rodriguez stole the show with two more goals. Getafe registered their first win of the season with a 2-0 victory over Murcia. Substitute Kepa, who was later sent off, opened the scoring in the 54th minute and Francisco Casero added a second five minutes later to clinch the points. Elsewhere last season's second division champions Valladolid continue to struggle in the top flight, crashing to a 2-1 defeat against Athletic Bilbao. Artiz Aduriz scored twice for Bilbao after eight and 31 minutes to leave Valladolid second from bottom with promoted Levante, who have a meagre one point, propping up the table.",0
"Summary: White truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road near time fire started. Charges filed against man who allegedly set small fire and walked off. Catalino Pineda one of five arrested in arson investigations this week. Arson investigations continue across multiple California counties. Article: Officials are searching for the driver of a white truck seen on Santiago Canyon Road on Sunday, near the time the Santiago fire started, Orange County authorities said Friday. Chief Chip Prather holds a photo of a white truck similar to the one seen on Santiago Canyon Road. ""These people are not suspects at this time,"" Orange County Fire Authority Chief Chip Prather said. ""They are persons of interest who were seen near the fire in a vehicle like this."" The vehicle is a white, 1998 to 2004 Ford F150 pickup with chrome tubular running boards. Prather said the information came from a lead called into the investigation's tip line. A $250,000 reward has been offered for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the blaze. Watch how residents feel about arsonist ». The Santiago fire, now 27,000 acres and still burning, was deliberately set, officials said Thursday. Several mandatory evacuations remain in place for the Santiago fire, which has destroyed 14 homes and various other structures. Late Friday afternoon, the blaze moved into Silverado Canyon, authorities said. Sheriff's deputies were evacuating residents in the fire's path. Watch the Santiago flames rage ». Authorities also suspect arson in the Rosa fire in San Diego County, which burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained. There was no information on the investigation. Elsewhere, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office filed arson charges Friday against a 41-year-old Sun Valley man who witnesses said set a fire in the West Hills neighborhood and walked away. Catalino Pineda is one of five people who have been arrested in arson investigations this week, but none of them has been linked to the major wildfires raging across Southern California. Pineda was arrested Wednesday after witnesses said they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside, police said. The fire was quickly extinguished. The witnesses followed Pineda to a nearby restaurant and called police, who arrested him. Pineda was expected to be arraigned in Van Nuys Superior Court Friday, Deputy District Attorney Steven Frankland said. He is charged with one count of arson of a structure or forest. Pineda is being held on $75,000 bail and faces up to six years in prison if convicted. In San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles, John Rund, of Hesperia, was arrested Wednesday on arson charges after a witness reported seeing him in brush near the starting point of a fire Tuesday, the sheriff's department said. That fire was quickly put out by passers-by. Investigators are trying to determine if Rund, 48, may have ties to other wildfires. He is being held on $750,000 bail. The San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office on Thursday filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail. In San Diego County, the sheriff's department this week arrested an adult and a juvenile allegedly seen by an anonymous tipster starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 11,675-acre Slide fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed in the past week by Southern California wildfires.",0

"Summary: Scottish league leaders Celtic held 1-1 at home by managerless Hibernian. Celtic now lead by three points, having taken just six from last five games. Second-placed Rangers have three games in hand ahead of trip to Aberdeen. Article: Scottish Premier League leaders Celtic suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless Hibernian on Saturday. David Murphy's goals have earned Hibernian four points against the Auld Firm this season. Gordon Strachan's team head the table by three points from Glasgow rivals Rangers, who have three games in hand ahead of Sunday's trip to Aberdeen. Visiting Hibernian, whose manager John Collins surprisingly resigned on Thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the Edinburgh side's board, took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back David Murphy. The Englishman played a one-two with Abdessalam Benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper Mark Brown and in off the crossbar. Murphy's only other goal this season came in Hibs' 1-0 win at Rangers on October 6. Brown did well to keep out Merouane Zemmama's audacious shot from just inside the Celtic half soon after, and also tipped over Brian Kerr's looping header three minutes after half-time. Substitute Jiri Jarosik rescued Celtic from a first home SPL defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, who then headed against the post with two minutes to play. Hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men, after Benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used. The victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place, while Celtic have taken just six points from the last five games. Strachan, who confirmed he is hoping to sign Brazilian defender Coelho next month, said: ""We need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season, they are silly mistakes. ""We could have definitely done something with every one of them. I'm happy with the number of chance we've made in the last few weeks, but unhappy with individual mistakes. ""It's not been great to look at, and we need to cut it out. We have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying, 'That was my fault.' ""I said to them, 'It's very commendable lads but we can't keep doing this.' There has been a lot going right for us, but one or two things going wrong. We have to deal with that, and then I will look forward to the rest of the season."" Third-placed Motherwell missed the chance to move above Rangers after being beaten 3-0 at home by Falkirk, who climbed to ninth with two goals in the second half to Michael Higdon and then another from Patrick Clegg on 65 minutes. Fourth-placed Dundee United failed to take advantage, losing 2-1 at home to bottom club Gretna -- whose only two wins this season have come against the Tangerines. Kenny Deuchar put the visitors ahead in the 12th minute before striker Noel Hunt leveled on 29, and Nicky Deverdics scored the eventual winner for the Borders outfit three minutes before half-time. Inverness Caledonian Thistle followed up last weekend's shock 3-2 victory against Celtic by also winning at Hearts by the same scoreline. The visitors led through Russell Duncan after 22 minutes and John Rankin made it 2-0 with a 53rd-minute penalty before Christophe Berra pulled one back on 62 and Lithuanian striker Andrius Velicka leveled from the spot (90). However, Graham Bayne scored a dramatic injury-time winner to lift Caley into the top six. In Saturday's other game, second-bottom St Mirren drew 0-0 at home to fellow strugglers Kilmarnock to be left seven points ahead of Gretna.",0
"Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer: Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.",0

Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Answer: Hospital preparedness can be better defined by a fixed number of casualties rather than a percentile of its bed capacity. Only 20% of the arriving casualties will require immediate medical treatment. Implementation of this concept may improve the utilisation of national emergency health resources both in the preparation phase and on real time.,0
"Summary: Earth has warmed one degree in past 100 years. Majority of scientists say greenhouse gases are causing temperatures to rise. Some critics say planets often in periods of warming or cooling. Article: Explorer Dennis Schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near Greenland. Fishermen pass by Greenland's Ilulissat fjord in this September 2004 picture. Such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity, even wonder perhaps, but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer. The island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to Greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier. But such a large amount of ice melted, it revealed the distinct island. ""I very quickly realized two things,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year. ""One [was] that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change."" ""The other thing was that it meant it was really happening. It wasn't a joke. It wasn't just statistics. It was really happening."" He calls his discovery Warming Island. Many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the Earth's climate are the result of an increase in the world's temperature, a trend widely called global warming. Many global warming experts say the phenomenon, if unchecked, is capable of altering the world's climate and geography. In the worst-case scenario, experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels, flooding cities and altering seashores. Other scientists and observers, a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous, say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet's life. Most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere. But why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious. The Earth's temperature averages about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (about 16 degrees Celsius). The average surface temperature has warmed one degree Fahrenheit (0.6 degrees Celsius) during the last century, according to the National Research Council. The temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. They rose till about 1945, cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day. There are several possible reasons for the warming, scientists say. A change in the Earth's orbit or the intensity of the sun's radiation could change, triggering warming or cooling. The reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet's temperature at a comfortable level. The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, for instance, has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age, according to the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, commonly referred to as the IPCC. The presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels, but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades, according to the EPA. Meanwhile, nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years. Many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities, like the burning of fossil fuels, emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests. ""For the last 30 years, there's no way there's anything natural that can explain it,"" Stephen Schneider, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University in California, said. ""A vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming,"" he added. Many scientific organizations share Schneider's view, ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the G8 to the National Research Council, the American Meteorological Society and the American Geophysical Union. But there are those who do not share his view, and among the skeptics is Richard Lindzen, a professor of atmospheric sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""We've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves,"" he said. ""When we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970, we were proclaiming global cooling. Since then, there's been a few tenths of global warming, so we're proclaiming global warming."" He believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability, where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal. ""The Earth is always getting colder and warmer,"" he said. ""It's always changing. In fact, this is true of any fluid-covered planet."" Asked about glacial melt, which many observers point to as evidence of global warming, Lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained. ""We don't know why, but it's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they've occurred,"" he said. ""What we're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that's occurring due to global warming."" Yet, for Schneider, it is a cause for concern and alarm. ""We're already in serious melt, nobody can explain it. The models don't predict it,"" he said. ""We don't know what's going on up there. All we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty."" The greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world's nations. The IPCC in February 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels, temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius) by 2100. The lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes, droughts, wildfires and flooding, Schneider said. The higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of Hollywood filmmakers. Uncertainties, however, plague such forecasts, which are based on computer simulations and models. The models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere, oceans and continents interact, all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them. ""Exactly how much it's going to warm up, we don't know,"" Schneider said. ""That it's going to warm up? I'd bet anything on that.""",0
"Prompt: Every person in the world develops a weird mutation/power the day they turn 16. Everyone 's powers are always different, some more insignificant than others. You turn 16, and watch as all your friends discover their newfound ability 's. That is, until you discover the severity of your own. Story: ""Last month Bobby, Joe, and Suzie all had their birthdays. Last week was Jack and Tim. All my friends had gotten their powers, hell most of the school had, the ones who can't fly got their licenses. I hate having a birthday at the end of the year.... Finally, it's going to be my turn! Tomorrow is MY birthday. Tomorrow is MY Advancement Day"" Wesley thought to himself. An enormous bird flaps its wings to slow down its quick decent. With gusts of wind this gargantuan beast stretched out one leg searching for the ground. Once a single talon had touched the parking lot the bird stopped flapping, landed, and Wesley hopped to the ground from the back of the bird. ""Thanks for the ride Tim! Your flying has really improved."" Wesley said to the bird. The beast begins to shake and wretch. It tucks its head under its wing. Feathers begin to molt off and fall onto the ground. The super sized bird begins to shrink into a ball of feathers. ""Don't know if I'll ever get used to seeing that, though"" Wesley thought to himself. What remained from the morphing was a pile of large feathers. From the center of the pile rose a boy. ""Thanks, sorry about the turbulence, had to dodge Geoff up there."" Tim responded. ""No problem, that guy doesn't what he's doing in the sky."" Wesley said brushing off the near mid air collision of the flight over. ""So, tomorrow's your big day, eh? Are you excited? Scared?"" Tim said as he prodded Wesley. Wesley's shoulders went up in defense as he started to dodge Tim. ""You could end up in the skies with me, or maybe under ground with the diggers. You could even become invincible."" ""Yeah yeah,'THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS' just like they tell us."" Wesley replied. As they walk into the school the rest of their group of friends start to gather. Everyone joking, laughing, talking about their new found abilities. Some were arguing over who is more powerful, more practical. Wesley was quiet, as he had no power to discuss. He sulked, and fell into the background. He didn't even listen to them any more. All around the schoolyard and parking lot there were groups of kids. The younger kids who were still a year or more away from their Advancement Day could be seen pretending to have some of the powers that their older counterparts already have. Some of the upperclassmen were testing their skills against one another, others using theirs to get laughs or entertain. ""All year with this, tomorrow will finally be different"" Wesley murmured to himself. The bell rings and the mass of kids flood into the school. The last cracks of electricity, cries of animals, puffs of flames and the rest of the calamity quells. In the classroom using your Advanced ability was strictly prohibited. Most kids wouldn't even dare. However, when the occasional person had an outburst the instructor was quick to put an end to it. All instructors have to be at least a level 3 practitioner. It's not easy to achieve so most instructors have little patience for the undisciplined youth. Wesley just wanted to make it through the day, but one of his classmates decided to make today a little longer. Wesley made his way through English class, then history. He at a normal lunch. There was a short fight out side but Wesley paid it no mind. Focusing on his food and pondering what tomorrow would bring as flashes of light and terrible sounds came from outside. After lunch was math. Wesley some times struggled with some of the formulas, but he managed. Even his test, which was mere minutes away, could not distract him from wondering how different tomorrow would be. Once in math he was forced to focus on his test. Everyone was quiet, heads down, pencils scribbling away. The sounds of erasers rubbing against paper filled the room along with grunts of frustration. The instructor was leaning back in his chair reading a book. Wesley got up, and took his paper to the front of the class and headed towards the instructor. ""Excuse me sir, can I ask you..."" Wesley started to ask the instructor. With out looking up from his book the instructor interrupts ""No questions, this is a test."" Wesley slinks back to his seat, red faced with embarrassment. A class mate grunts and slams his desk. Wesley looks over as he takes his seat to see Frankie red faced with frustration. ""He looks like he's steaming."" Wesley thought. Suddenly Frankie is clenching all his muscled, hunched over his desk teeth gritting. Wesley looks again and sees steam rising off Frankie's back and shoulders. ""Uh oh, he's gon na blow."" Wesley thinks. From the silence a spark can be heard. Then a crackle. Wesley watches as small flames begin to produce themselves slowly on Frankie's body. Then in the blink of an eye Frankie is up in flames. A woosh signals his transformation as he is engulfed in flames. By this time everyone looks up from their tests as the boy covered in flames can not be ignored. Frankie's frustration shines through as a resounding growl comes from the body of flames and the desk melts away beneath him. Suddenly the chair behind the instructor's desk falls to the ground. Everyone in the classroom shifts their gaze to the front to see the chair still moving tipped over on the ground but the instructor was no where to be found. ""Did.... did he leave us?"" Wesley began to think but before he could contemplate what to do with out the instructor a loud crash brings everyone's attention back to Frankie's direction. The instructor seemed to come from thin air, above Frankie and his flickering flames, crashing down into Frankie's back with one hand extended. The instructor had his palm between Frankie's shoulder blades pinning Frankie to the ground. Frankie's flames seemed to extinguish themselves as he lay beneath the arm and hand of the instructor. ""What did you do to him?"" a girl named Sarah calls out from the other side of the room. ""He'll be fine."" replies the instructor as he gets up and two staff from the nurses station rush in to collect Frankie. ""Back to your tests, you only have 5 more minutes."" Almost in unison the classroom snaps back to having their heads down focusing on their papers in front of them. Everyone acts like nothing had happened. This wasn't an every day occurrence but it was common enough not to be too much of a spectacle.",0

He says: We are the principal actors, but ... are never listened to."" Article: Italy and Roma striker Francesco Totti has threatened to quit the Italian Players Association, in a row over the starting date of the next Serie A season. Roma striker Totti has complained that the Italian players are never listened to. The row began last month, when the Italian Football League, which is run by the presidents of clubs in the country's top two divisions, voted to start the season on August 26. In doing so, they ignored a request by Italy coach Roberto Donadoni to play the first round of matches midway through the month, to give his players time to gain match-fitness ahead of Euro 2008 qualifiers against France and Ukraine in early September. ""I'm ready to leave the Italian Players Association. We are the principal actors, but also the people who are never listened to,"" Totti was quoted as saying in Italian football magazine Dieci. ""This is the moment in which we must make our voice heard. We wanted to start on August 19, to have an extra week's rest at Christmas and allow the national team to come into the big matches in September better prepared. ""Those who decided (on August 26) didn't care at all about Donadoni's needs."" Serie A is one of the last major European leagues to start next season. The opening round of English Premier League matches is scheduled to start on August 11, while the French Ligue 1 will kick off on August 4.",0

"Prompt: In the near future, mankind explores the stars in search of life. Life indeed exists beyond Earth, but you, a researcher on a science ship, discover that all of the spacefaring alien civilizations died out. Curiously, their deaths seem directly linked to humanity reaching outer space. Story: “ Captain? ” The intern whispered, glancing at the older man who had frozen immediately at the sight. “ Captain? ” She tried again, startling the man from his reverie. He shuddered before walking quickly towards the mass grave, stooping to jump into the hole. “ Come on. ” Goddammit, she didn't sign up to wallow in a trench filled with dead aliens. “ Paid. This needs to be a paid internship, ” she muttered as she joined the captain. Chuckling, the captain started rummaging through the bodies as she studied the closest body to her. The body's pale periwinkle had darkened to a midnight blue in places. Bruises, she assumed, that the aliens sustained during the fight with whatever caused this. The bloodshot eyes from another body nearby stared into her own listlessly. Most of the bodies near her were covered in blood and yet she could find no exit or entry wound, though she couldn't look too closely without feeling nauseous. A click from behind caused the intern to jump, quickly turning around to see the source of the noise. A quiet hiss of air went off as she saw her captain take off his helmet. “ Captain! What are you doi-, “ He cut her off, shoving a bolt of cotton cloth into her arms. “ Russia got here first. ” She spread out the cloth to see the red, white, and blue stripes that signified their ally/enemy/whatever they happen to be this year. She swallowed thickly, peering down once again at the bodies. “ They… They beat them to death. My god, Captain, they literally beat these people to death. ” He nodded in response, before grabbing the arms of an alien near them. “ We might as well take one in for the scientists. ” She grabbed the legs and dragged the body into the ship. The scientists, clinical and steadfast as they were, greeted them with syringes and biohazard bags, already looking forward to the catch. They chattered excitedly amongst themselves, poking and prodding as soon as the body hit the table. She gagged at the sight, rushing to strip herself from her bloody suit as the intern in the science department called after her, “ We'll bring y'all results at the meetin'next week! ” ~ The intern sat quietly at the round table, waiting for the scientists to arrive for their report. The captain went into a coughing fit, but neither spoke up. She looked up as the door opened, the other intern entered first, grinning and bouncing on her feet excitedly, but the rest of the science department looked grim as they sat down. “ We have some news. ” The captain coughed again beside her.",0
"Prompt: Berlin, 1943. You 're a Jew who has been successfully keeping a low profile while working as a clerk under the 3rd Reich.

HIM! ” Jamie had snatched up the slip and had scanned through it at a speed far surprising the normal 7-year-old reading speed. Before I could react, he was prancing around the living room, hopping from sofa to ground and back again. Sometimes I don't know whether to be proud of him, knowing that he'll never spread his wings under the red swastika. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Yes dear, maybe I will— “ “ Maybe? No maybes!

He was still oblivious to my dilemma, giggling away and waving the paper around like a trophy. I'm going to tell everybody! Ruth and Erik from school — There he was, the perfect Aryan. Shimmering golden hair, blueish eyes and pale complexion, his cheeks flushed from hopping around. *Pitter patter, pitter patter* *Perhaps…* -- -- - “ Here we are, Miss, ” the uniformed chauffeur opened the limousine door, his gloved hand extended towards me.

There was a percussive tapping from the drizzle on the black umbrella held overhead. “ Young Sir, here you go, ” Jamie was helped out after me, in his black school jacket and pressed shirt. My little man. We were brought up a flight of stairs and through grand double doors. Jamie's eyes flew left and right, taking in the grandeur of room after room, a level of wealth he had never experienced. A uniformed SS officer sat by a stairwell, peering at us intently through his horn-rimmed glasses. “ Documents please ” I offered my papers and the announcement slip to him. He flipped through the papers lazily. “ Ma'am, you do understand that this is for a single person, yes? ” His eyes were focusing on Jamie, who was still in disbelief that he was this up close with an SS officer. “ Oh Sir, I do understand, but he's such an angel and would absolutely love to meet the Führer in person— “ “ One person only! Can't you read? ” My legs were shaking, palms sweaty, heart palpitating. My hand reached out for Jamie, gripping his shoulder a little too tightly. “ But Sir, please! ” Silence. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ Well, all right. Papers please. ” Rustling. Pause. More rustling. “ Never left Berlin all your life? ” “ Ja. ” “ Well, Ma'am, I'm sorry for the loss of your husband. He must have faced the enemy gallantly. ” “ Danke, ” In reality, he had been stolen away to one of the camps, back when Jamie was too young to remember. “ You can proceed up the stairs now. You—you be good to your Mom now! ” He ruffled Jamie's hair, a slight smile betraying his thin-lipped demeanour. Smiling broadly, I quickly guided Jamie up the stairs, my hand reaching out for the dark-stained wooden handrail. “ Miss, hold on. ” I almost sank to my knees. He must have realised that it was fake. We're doomed. *Pitter patter, pitter patter. * “ You forgot your papers. ” -- -- /r/Ziincworks",0
"Prompt: ( Harry Potter ) Born a squib to an elitist wizard family, you ran away to attend muggle school. You are now the only human alive with extensive knowledge of both magic and muggle technology. Story: He had finally done it! After six years of research and experiments, Jack had finally isolated the particle responsible for the existence of magic. He pumped his fist in the air in celebration, reveling in the fact the he had just spit in the face of physics. He even gave Oliver a gruesome bear hug, despite the homeless wizard's alcoholic stench. This discovery was going to change everything. Every field of science from genetics to astronomy was going to evolve thanks to this new knowledge. All that was left was to name the particle and submit his findings. Jack was having trouble with the former issue. He would love to have his name plastered all over future textbooks, but Jack Smith particle lacked elegance when written next to Higgs boson. Perhaps he could name it the Redbone particle. No, nothing would displease him more than having his birth family's name where his should be. Jack decided to skip the name problem for the moment. Particle M was a perfectly fine filler for the time being. He still needed to triple check all the calculations, and a second run of the experiment wouldn't hurt. Collecting his notes, the scientist decided to call it a day. Locking the lab door behind him, Jack escorted Oliver out of the campus building and paid him generously. “ Now, remember not to spend all of this on booze, ” he said, handing the wizard an inconspicuous box full of gold coins. “ And please don't show up drunk next time I call you. ” Oliver simply snorted. “ So long as I'm getting paid. ” The wizard started walking away, but quickly backtracked upon checking the box's contents. “ How the bloody hell did a muggle loving squib get his hands on this many Galleons, if you don't mind me asking? ” Jack grated his teeth at the word squib, but held his temper. “ I'm a genius physicist that just found scientific evidence of how magic works. Do you really think it would be that hard for me to obtain a few measly coins? ” Oliver shook his head, mumbling obscenities as he walked away. Jack watched the man for a few seconds before he disappeared into thin air. Looking around, Jack confirmed that he was the only one to notice that Oliver was ever even there and started walking to his car. He would love nothing more than to give a wizard a piece of his mind one of these days. Actually, that wasn't entirely true. Jack would love nothing more than to win a Nobel prize, but showing some witch bitch that gun beats stick was a close second. Jack shook his head, expelling any thoughts of wizards from his mind. He was a genius. Such hellish violence was below him. All he needed was some food. His last meal was breakfast and it was now well into the afternoon. Some pizza and a beer would help his mood. Unfortunately, the pizza would have to wait. As he approached his car, Jack saw a woman in a short, victorian black dress was knocking on the window. His initial thought was to run and call campus security, but at the same time was just wanting to go get dinner. It would be easier to politely ask the woman to leave, and only run away if she pulled a knife on him. “ Excuse ma'am, that's my car you are tapping on, ” he said in a cheery voice. The woman turned around, causing Jack to go wide-eyed in shock. “ Mom?! ” *Perhaps I should have called security. * “ Oh, there you are William. I didn't know you were out. You might want to consider getting a bigger house. ”",0
"Summary: BUPA was founded in 1947 in response to plans to establish the NHS. The company's biggest base is in the UK but has customers in three continents. BUPA care homes cater for a number of conditions, including Parkinson's. Article: BUPA is an international health and care company with bases on three continents and more than eight million customers. BUPA began as The British United Provident Association in 1947 to preserve freedom of choice in health care. It believed that with a National Health Service being introduced a year later, there would still be a need for a complimentary service enabling people from all walks of life to afford the benefits of choice in where, when and by whom they were treated. Led by the growing public demand for health care and a lack of quality private accommodation BUPA initiated the Nuffield Homes Charitable Trust - later renamed Nuffield Hospitals. BUPA's biggest and original business is health insurance in the UK, both for individuals and corporations that want to look after the health of their employees. More than half of the UK's top companies are BUPA customers. The company's UK care homes offer specialist care to residents who include the elderly, the mentally ill, young people with physical or learning disabilities and people with conditions such as Parkinson's and Huntington's diseases. BUPA is a leading healthcare company in the UK, Spain, Australia, Ireland, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malta and Saudi Arabia. BUPA International supplies health cover to expatriates in over 180 countries. Sanitas, the BUPA business in Spain, has one million insured customers who have access to a network of 18,000 medical professionals and 450 medical centres.",0
"Question: 30-Day and 1-year mortality in emergency general surgery laparotomies: an area of concern and need for improvement? Answer: Emergency laparotomy carries a high rate of mortality, especially in those over the age of 70 years, and more needs to be done to improve outcomes, particularly in this group. This could involve increasing acute surgical care manpower, early recognition of patients requiring emergency surgery, development of clear management protocols for such patients or perhaps even considering centralisation of emergency surgical services to specialist centres with multidisciplinary teams involving emergency surgeons and care of the elderly physicians in hospital and related community outreach services for post-discharge care.",0
"Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Answer: Speed discrimination, per se, is not impaired in schizophrenia patients. The observed abnormality appears to be a consequence of impairment in generating or integrating the feedback information from eye movements. This study introduces a novel approach to motion perception studies and highlights the importance of concurrently measuring eye movements to understand interactions between these two systems; the results argue for a conceptual revision regarding motion perception abnormality in schizophrenia.",0
"Summary: President Bush will have a routine colonoscopy Saturday. While he's anesthetized, his powers will be transferred to the vice president. Bush had last colonoscopy in 2002, which found no problems. Article: Vice President Dick Cheney will serve as acting president briefly Saturday while President Bush is anesthetized for a routine colonoscopy, White House spokesman Tony Snow said Friday. Bush is scheduled to have the medical procedure, expected to take about 2 1/2 hours, at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, Snow said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. The procedure will be supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, Snow said. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said that was the case when Bush had colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver. Snow told reporters he had a chemo session scheduled later Friday. Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer ». ""The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance,"" Snow said. The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high-risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50.",0

"Summary: Frank Lloyd Wright wanted store magnate to sleep on porch. Salvador Dalí's stated ambitions were bigger than Napoleon's. Ayn Rand: Laughing at yourself same as ""spitting in your own face"" Article: They say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing. But not for these folks! Long before the Material Girl ordered papa to stop preaching, these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose. Alfred Hitchcock didn't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors. Here's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form. Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock was, without question, one of the towering geniuses of cinema. And, like many greats, he wasn't exactly the best collaborator. Hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters, who felt he never properly credited them for their work. But he was notoriously hard on actors. He was once quoted as saying, ""Actors are cattle"" -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry (actors can be so touchy). In response, he issued this correction: ""I have been misquoted. What I really said is, 'Actors should be treated as cattle.'"" Although it began accidentally (when he was short an actor for the film ""The Lodger""), Hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films, amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career. Ayn Rand. The egotist's egotist, author Ayn Rand (born Alissa Zinovievna Rosenbaum) is the patron saint of Thinking You're Better Than Everybody Else. Her most famous novels, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, are massive dramatizations of Objectivism, her self-spun Oscar-the-Grouch philosophy for success. Objectivism champions ego and accomplishment, shuns all religion as folly, and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society. Rand's novels often focus on protagonists (invariably men) who are shunned by others because of their genius, but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant. Not surprisingly, she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as ""spitting in your own face."" So, just how much did Rand believe in her own philosophy? Let's just say a lot. With signature modesty, she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Orson Welles. When you create a cinematic masterpiece such as ""Citizen Kane"" at the ripe old age of 25, you're bound to get a big head. But Welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that. In fact, ""Citizen Kane"" might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego. After all, it's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst because Hearst slighted Welles at a dinner party. Of course, after the unparalleled success of ""Citizen Kane,"" Welles's arrogant side didn't get any less subtle. Do yourself a favor: Track down a recording of Welles' outtakes for a TV commercial for frozen peas. You'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker's oversized ego. A classic quote goes: ""In the depths of your ignorance, what is it you want?"" Frank Lloyd Wright. As the brains behind the Robie House, Fallingwater, Taliesin West, the Guggenheim, and countless other design benchmarks, Frank Lloyd Wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture. And, boy, did he know it! Wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals. In fact, the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him. But when you're Wright, you're right. In 1935, department store magnate Stanley Marcus (of Neiman-Marcus fame) commissioned the architect to design his Dallas home, but the project quickly went sour. Wright's avant-garde floor plan included ""sleeping porches"" that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round. In addition, Marcus' small bedroom ""cubicles"" came equipped with almost no closet space. When Stanley respectfully explained that (a) temperatures during summer nights in Dallas often exceed 80 degrees and (b) a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets, Wright threw a series of tantrums. Fortunately for the voyeur in us all, said tantrums usually took place in letter form. Preserved and occasionally displayed at the Dallas Museum of Art, they make for delicious reading. Salvador Dalí. ""Every morning when I awake, the greatest of joys is mine: that of being Salvador Dalí."" Yup, he actually said that. Everything about the legendary Surrealist painter (he of the melting clocks) -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock, destroy convention, cause scandal, and stir controversy. Criticized for choosing to live under General Franco's fascist government in Spain, Dalí defended his position by stating that he didn't care about others so long as he could be king. Not exactly a man of the people. If he wasn't getting enough attention, he was known to walk the streets of New York City clanging a hand bell. Of course, this is also the guy who once said, ""The thought of not being recognized [is] unbearable."" Need another telling quote? ""At the age of 6 years, I wanted to be a chef. At the age of 7, I wanted to be Napoleon. My ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since."" Apparently, so did his ego. Al Jolson. Plenty of performers this side of Gallagher have been labeled ""the world's greatest entertainer."" But Al Jolson really, really believed it. The vaudeville singer, actor, dancer, and comedian was born Asa Yoelson in Seredzius, Lithuania, in what was then part of Imperial Russia. As a performer, he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows, ad-libbing, or just stopping to talk to the audience. During a 1911 performance of the critically hated ""Paris is a Paradise for Coons"" (title not edited for political correctness), Jolson stopped and asked the audience if they'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play. The crowd roared with applause, and Jolson ditched the whole program and took over. From that moment on, no one else could share the stage with him. Unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list, however, Jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance. According to most contemporary accounts, he actually was the greatest in the world. But, despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen, Jolson's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface (considered highly offensive now, but pretty common at the time).

"Summary: British teacher in Sudan found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons, 54, arrested after her class named teddy bear ""Mohammed"" Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her. UK consular staff, Gibbons' defense team initially refused access to the court. Article: A Sudanese court found a British teacher guilty of insulting religion and sentenced her to 15 days in prison Thursday for allowing a teddy bear to be named ""Mohammed,"" British authorities and her lawyer reported. An undated amateur photo of Gillian Gibbons, who has been found guilty of insulting religion. Gillian Gibbons also faces deportation from Sudan after her prison term, her lawyer told CNN. He said that he was ""very disappointed"" with the verdict and that Gibbons planned to appeal. Gibbons was not convicted of two other charges brought against her -- inciting hatred and showing contempt for religious beliefs, her lawyer said. Gibbons, 54, was arrested Sunday after she asked her class of 7-year-olds in Khartoum to name the stuffed animal as part of a school project, the British Foreign Office said. She had faced charges under Article 125 of Sudan's constitution, the law relating to insulting religion and inciting hatred. Although there is no ban in the Quran on images of Allah or the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder, likenesses are considered highly offensive by Muslims. Watch latest developments in the case. ». Appearing somber and dazed, Gibbons arrived at the central courthouse in Khartoum for her closed hearing early Thursday. A staff member from the British Embassy in Khartoum and defense lawyers attended the hearing with her. The courthouse was heavily guarded by police, who kept journalists -- and, for a while, even one of her attorneys -- away. Gibbons could have faced a sentence of 40 lashes, a fine, or a jail term of up to a year, according to the Foreign Office, which expressed Britain's dissatisfaction with the verdict. ""We are extremely disappointed that the charges against Gillian Gibbons were not dismissed,"" Foreign Secretary David Miliband said in a statement issued shortly after the verdict was announced. ""As I said this morning, our clear view is that this is an innocent misunderstanding by a dedicated teacher. Our priority now is to ensure Ms. Gibbons' welfare, and we will continue to provide consular assistance to her. I have called in the Sudanese ambassador, Omer Siddig, this evening to explain the decision and discuss next steps."" Watch a report on reactions to the verdict ». The Foreign Office said Gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest, meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence. Earlier, Miliband had met with Siddig, who was summoned to the Foreign Office in London. ""I explained to him that we were very concerned by the case. We believe that this was an innocent misunderstanding,"" Miliband said in a statement released Thursday after the meeting. ""The Sudanese ambassador undertook to ensure our concerns were relayed to Khartoum at the highest level. He also said he would reflect back to Khartoum the real respect for the Islamic religion in this country,"" the statement added. On the first floor of the courthouse, around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and British officials away from the court entrance. Police detained some journalists, and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance CNN cameraman. Four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse, but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests. Staff from Gibbons' school, including Robert Boulos, the head of Unity High School, were present. The staff members refused to comment on their colleague's predicament. On Wednesday, Boulos said he was ""horrified"" when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent, as originally thought. Defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from Sarah Khawad, a secretary at the school. Gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy Sudanese and expatriates -- since August, after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in Liverpool, England, this summer, Boulos said. He said Gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot, which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats.

"Summary: Nasser al Ansari is CEO of Qatari Diar, Qatar's state-owned investment group. Its global projects are part of nation's attempt to diversify investment portfolio. Investment also aims to bring expertise and jobs to neighboring countries. Article: Nasser al Ansari is the CEO of Qatari Diar, a state-owned real estate investment company. Famous for its purchase of London's Chelsea Barracks, Qatari Diar was established in 2004 by the Qatar Investment Authority, to support Qatar's growing economy and to co-ordinate the country's real estate development priorities. It is now valued at $1 billion with 18 projects underway. Al Ansari is a graduate from the University of Miami and was responsible for high profile projects such as New Doha International Airport and the promotion of private sector investment through public sector privatization. Before being appointed as CEO of Qatari Diar, Al Ansari was at the office of the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs as technical advisor. He joins us on MME to talk about the vision for Qatar, how Qatari Diar fits into it and its investments outside Gulf in Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Egypt and Europe. With oil prices hitting $88 this week, John Defterios begins by asking Nasser al Ansari about the differences he sees now compared to the 1970s when oil prices were also high. Any lessons learned? Nasser al Ansari: I believe so. In the 1970s, local government here did not deal in a very sophisticated way with this wealth. But now we are fortunate with a high level of education and the reformations in government policies in this region. We now understand how to utilize this wealth and economical growth. JD: I don't think most people know that you sit on one of the largest natural gas fields in the world and will likely be the largest exporter by 2010. This must give you great cushion to expand the Qatari Diar model. NA: Although we have this and we are fortunate with this, Qatar has adopted a policy to diversify its portfolio from its natural resources to other investment opportunities and one of them is Qatari Diar. We are investing a lot in real estate, not just in Qatar but worldwide. JD: In fact very close in the neighborhood as well. It's almost foreign policy strategy to invest in the poorer countries in the region. Is this to help the neighborhood develop alongside Qatar? NA: I think with the knowledge and know-how that we have gained in this area of expertise, we would like to export it to other countries to help their economical reformations; to try to create business opportunities for their local businessmen and to create job opportunities for the people in that particular country. JD: It's quite a radical departure say from the International Monetary Fund or World Bank giving loans or grants for development. This is turning the world upside down in your region, it is not? NA: Yes, I would like to assure you at Qatari Diar we are not in the business of lending. JD: You want a hard return. NA: We want return but we always think of the people when we are investing in these countries. I mean we want to make sure that the investment we are making is there for the long-term. Qatari Diar has a policy: it's a long-term policy not short-term. JD: Give me some insight on why Qatari Diar feels as comfortable in London with Chelsea Barracks as in Cuba, for example, with some of the projects you're undertaking. What makes you think you can pull that off? NA: I think with the expertise that we have and with the strength that we have, we would like to showcase the strength of the people of Qatar and we want to pull the flag of the state of Qatar even across the Atlantic and we are determined to do so. We are a small country but with big ideas.",0
"Summary: Cpl. Trent D. Thomas found guilty this week of conspiracy to commit murder. Marine gets rank of private, will be discharged for role in death of Iraqi civilian. Group's leader awaits trial on murder and conspiracy charges. Article: A Marine convicted for his role in the death of an Iraqi civilian was sentenced Friday to a reduction in rank and will be discharged. Cpl. Trent D. Thomas was found guilty Wednesday of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit several offenses -- including murder, larceny, housebreaking, kidnapping, and making false official statements -- for his involvement in the April 2006 death in Hamdaniya, Iraq. Thomas will be demoted to the rank of entry-level private and will receive a bad-conduct discharge. The 25-year-old was among seven Marines and a Navy medic who were charged in connection with the death of Hashim Ibrahim Awad, 52. The Marines accused in the case were members of Kilo Company, 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. They reported at the time that Awad planned to detonate a roadside bomb targeting their patrol. But several residents of Hamdaniya, including relatives of the victim, gave a different account, prompting a criminal investigation. Prosecutors accuse the group's squad leader, Sgt. Lawrence G. Hutchins III, of dragging Awad from his home, shooting him in the street and then making it look like he had planned to ambush American troops. Hutchins has pleaded not guilty to murder, conspiracy and other charges in the case. He faces a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Thomas changed his plea from guilty to not guilty in February, arguing that he had merely followed orders. He told his attorneys that after reviewing the evidence against him, he realized ""that what happened overseas happened as a result of obedience to orders, and he hasn't done anything wrong,"" defense attorney Victor Kelley said. Thomas said in January, shortly after entering his guilty plea, that he was ""truly sorry"" for his role in the killing. He could have been sentenced to life in prison under his original plea.",0
"Summary: Experts gather at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit to propose obesity solutions. Former President Clinton: Without obesity solution, nation risks ""collapse"" Motivating youngsters, removing shame, embarrassment called key. Experts: Removing trans fats, finding healthy replacements also critical. Article: Obesity is the No. 1 health crisis in the United States, and the nation could be at risk without immediate action, former President Clinton said at CNN's first Fit Nation Summit. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta and former President Clinton lead the discussion at the first Fit Nation Summit. ""We need to do something about it for our children, and for our country, because something like this could easily collapse our nation if we don't act now,"" Clinton said. Clinton and CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, gathered with experts from across the country Wednesday to explore solutions to America's obesity crisis. Two-thirds of adult Americans are overweight or obese; the same is true for one-third of U.S. children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Obesity carries increased risk of myriad health problems, including hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and arthritis. Gupta, Clinton and a panel of experts addressed such proposed solutions as healthy school lunches, elimination of trans fats, the need for healthier food in urban communities and the importance of supporting community-based efforts to fight obesity. Watch Gupta explain the solutions proposed at the Fit Nation Summit ». Clinton, who's been tackling the obesity issue over the past few years with his Alliance for a Healthier Generation, stressed the need to help educate people about the importance of a healthy diet and exercising together. Motivating Americans, especially kids, won't be easy, Clinton said. ""They need to be handled with care. Kids need to know it's important, but [fitness] can't be boring,"" he said. ""There's no shame, there's no embarrassment. We have to let them know it's all good, but you have to do it."" Michael Jacobson, director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest and a strong advocate against trans fats in foods, stressed that the Food and Drug Administration should ban trans fats altogether and stop leaving it up to local and state governments. Trans fats, at one time, thought to be good fat substitutes, over the years have been shown to raise LDL or bad cholesterol in people and lower their HDL, or good cholesterol. ""They're just not good for our health, Jacobson said. However, Dr. Robert Eckel, former president of the American Heart Association, warned, ""Although we support the removal of trans fats, our biggest concern is what they'll be replaced with. We need to think about that, because there will be a substitute."" The panel took questions from an audience of 150 people -- mostly obesity experts or those who work in industries that deal with obesity. Gupta was inspired to launch Fit Nation, an ongoing, multiplatform, grass-roots initiative against obesity. Over the past three years, Gupta and the CNN Medical Unit have crisscrossed the country, asking Americans to take charge of their weight by exercising more and eating healthier. This year, Gupta traveled from Michigan to California asking the public to pledge to add 1 million hours to their collective lives by getting off the couch and exercising. Since he began the tour in April, the campaign has surpassed its goal, with exercise pledges close to four times that amount. Gupta said he hopes that legislators and administrators who can make a difference in policy and perhaps change attitudes about obesity will hear the solutions discussed at the summit. ""I''ve covered a lot of stories on obesity,"" Gupta said. ""There's a battle going on, and we need to win the battle. I've talked to people out there and many are just blasé. ""This is our opportunity to make them care.""",0

"Prompt: You look into the wallet of a man you just robbed at gunpoint. You find a suicide note. Story: How long had it been? Five minutes? Yeah, probably five minutes. Guy can run a long way in five minutes, right? I slow down, first to a jog, then to a walk, then finally to a stop. I lean against the alley's brick wall to catch my breath. I'd done this a hundred times, but this time was different. This time, something was weird. I tried to run through it again, trying to make sense of it. I could still see him there, on his knees in the snow. I barely even had my gun drawn when he just gave up, fell to the ground. For just a few beats, I had been so confused I couldn't think. People normally panic at this point, they normally start acting a little crazy or begging me not to kill them. He had just stared at me with those empty eyes, then reached into his pocket for his wallet and stretched out his hand to me, waiting. I had taken the wallet, faltered a little. ""Please..."" he whispered to me. I had just turned and ran. Why had he unnerved me so much? Oh yeah, the wallet. That was the point of this whole thing, right? Who cares what that guy's deal was? I take the wallet out of my jacket, and take off my gloves to get a feel of it. Leather. Good stuff too. I flip it open, and there's just.... nothing. No credit cards, empty photo sleeves, nothing. Seriously? Is this a joke? Dude was just messing with me the whole time? No wait, there's another pocket, probably where the cash is, right? I reach in and pulled out a piece of paper. Just a little slip, folded in on itself a few times, creased and worn and frayed around the edges. What was this, some old love note? Oh hey, passwords maybe? I unfold it, but the light is so dim. There's a light on right up the alley so I make my way to it to get a good look. It's a note. The handwriting is smooth and deliberate, with one single sentence in the middle of the page. ""I want to die."" Wait.... what...? I feel dizzy. My heart is racing. I realize I've forgotten to breathe. I just keep seeing it in my head, over and over. ""Please..."" he had said. The alley is spinning. I fall to the ground, crisp cold snow under my hands. Pull it together. Pull it.... together.... Wait. Wait.... I know what I have to do. Turns out a guy can't run all that far in five minutes, or maybe I underestimate my athletic ability. I had walked back the way I'd come, back to the park. It hadn't taken so long at all. The snow was starting to fall again and it glittered in the streetlights. I'm sure there were stars out, but you could never see them through the skyscrapers. I'd seen them once, on a camping trip, the last vacation we took before my dad split and my mom had to get a second job. I'd complained the whole car ride, bitched and moaned while we set up the tent and caught our dinner.... but man, when those stars had come out, I'd been speechless. There he is. He's still just down in the snow, like he was waiting for me. He doesn't even look up when my boots crunch up behind him. He doesn't even move when I put the gun to his head. I pull the trigger and he just slumps. I watch the snow turn red. It's falling harder now, maybe a real blizzard one of these days. I turn my face up to the sky and I think about stars.",0
"Summary: Laura Bush calls on Myanmar junta to ""step aside,"" allow for a democracy. Military leaders must give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people, she says. Junta should release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders, she says. Her rare foray into foreign policy was published in the Wall Street Journal. Article: U.S. first lady Laura Bush -- in a rare foray into foreign policy -- called on Myanmar's military junta to ""step aside,"" give up the ""terror campaigns"" against its people and allow for a democratic Myanmar in a commentary published in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal. U.S. first lady Laura Bush said the junta ""should step aside to make way for a unified Burma."" ""Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies are a friendless regime,"" Bush said. ""They should step aside to make way for a unified Burma [Myanmar] governed by legitimate leaders. ""The rest of the armed forces should not fear this transition -- there is room for a professional military in a democratic Burma,"" Bush said, in keeping with the U.S. policy of still using Myanmar's former name. In Wednesday's commentary, Bush called on Myanmar's military leaders to release Aun Sung Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders so they can meet with and plan for a transition to democracy. ""Meanwhile, the world watches -- and waits,"" Bush warns. ""We know that Gen. Than Shwe and his deputies have the advantage of violent force. But Ms. Suu Kyi and other opposition leaders have moral legitimacy, the support of the Burmese people and the support of the world. ""The regime's position grows weaker by the day. The generals' choice is clear: The time for a free Burma is now."" The humanitarian rights situation in Myanmar has been a cause for the first lady in the past few months as the crisis there worsened. Myanmar state media has reported that 2,000 people were detained during the demonstrations and the crackdown against them -- under an emergency law imposed on September 25 banning assembly of more than five people -- and that 700 of those people have been released. The official death toll from Myanmar's leadership is at 10, but there are reports that hundreds were killed and thousands arrested in the wake of the demonstrations that peaked late September, which were led by Myanmar's Buddhist monks. On Tuesday morning, Bush received a phone call from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to update her on the efforts of his special envoy to Myanmar, Ibrahim Gambari. A representative of the secretary general said the call was a follow-up to a conversation they had weeks ago. Gambari met last week with the military junta leadership as well as with Nobel Peace Prize winner Suu Kyi, who is under house arrest in Yangon. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, told reporters that Laura Bush and her husband's administration believe that there is a ""need to start preparing for transition"" for Myanmar. ""We believe it is very important that progress be made and prisoners be released and conditions for Aun Sung Suu Kyi be improved [so] that she can prepare for participation for negotiations for a transition,"" he said.",0

"Summary: More than 1,000 freed detainees reportedly keep pledge not to rejoin insurgency. U.S. general tries to reassure Sunnis that detainees face no abuse. More than 80 percent of detainees are Sunnis. U.S. airstrike kills 13 suspected terrorists west of Baghdad. Article: None of the 1,000-plus Iraqi detainees freed in recent weeks have broken a pledge not to return to the insurgency, according to the Marine general who oversees the U.S. detention centers in Iraq. A U.S. military panel reviews a detainee's case at Camp Cropper near Baghdad. Speaking in Arabic, Maj. Gen. Doug Stone on Wednesday reassured Iraqis about how the 25,000 detainees -- mostly Sunnis -- are treated after being taken into custody on suspicion of involvement in the insurgency. Stone described the detention system as ""open and transparent,"" saying it makes the detainees better citizens and helps break the cycle of violence and poverty in the country. Stone said detainees get free medical care equal to what he gets as a general, food and water made to Islamic standards, educational opportunities, jobs skills and contact with families. The U.S. detention centers -- at Camp Bucca near the southern port city of Basra and in Camp Cropper near Baghdad -- are political sore points for Sunnis, who make up 83 percent of the detainees held. The main Sunni political coalition -- the Iraqi Accord Front -- cited the centers as one reason for quitting the government during the summer. Last month, the U.S.-led coalition launched Operation Lion's Paw in which between 50 and 70 detainees would be released daily during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan after taking a pledge not to rejoin the insurgency against the Shiite-led government. ""This pledge is an Iraqi pledge, a pledge before an Iraqi judge, frequently with a family member present,"" Stone said. ""I am pleased to tell you that in the more 1,000 that have gone through this program and taken the pledge, not one has returned to threaten Iraqi or coalition forces."" Stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond Ramadan. Stone's description seems a far cry from the Abu Ghraib prison operated by the U.S. military in the first years after the invasion. That prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse. ""There are no secrets that go on in detention,"" Stone said. ""Our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible. These agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world."" See what life's like inside Camp Cropper's walls ». By the time of their release, ""detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment,"" he said. Each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level, and high school classes are being planned, Stone said. About one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school, with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level, he said. The 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school, Stone said. The average stay for a detainee is 300 days, but some have been detained for two years or longer, he said. A review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security, he said. If they are deemed not to be, they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge. Only 280 detainees are foreigners, mostly from Syria, Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Saudi Arabia, he said.

"Prompt: You have just been sworn in as President, and are being told the truth about alien life ... but it 's incredibly far from what anyone had ever imagined. Story: ""Congratulations, Mr. President."" The President smiled, ""Thank you Rodney."" ""I hope you have enjoyed the celebrations,"" said Rodney, ""and I believe your inaugural speech was a resounding success."" ""I thought so too, it seems we a have some excellent writers working behind the scenes."" ""I couldn't agree more, Mr. President."" The President couldn't help but notice a faint overstepping of honesty in that last comment, but chose instead to ignore it. ""So, what exactly am I expecting in this meeting?"" Rodney shrugged, turning to meet the President's questioning eyes, ""Not much, sir. This meeting is mostly just for show. More of a'get to know you' piece for you and the other leaders of various organisations."" ""The navy, army, air force, CIA, FBI? That sort of crowd?"" ""In a way. It's best for you to come into this with an open mind,"" Rodney said, opening the door to the situation room, ushering the president in before closing the door behind them. Rodney took a deep breath, and began counting to 10. He only got to 3. The piercing guttural scream that filled the room was, Rodney thought, impressive. He hadn't anticipated the President having such a high vocal range, nor powerful lung capacity. He administered the mild sedative that he held at his side, waited as the screams gradually lessened, and graciously caught the president as he slumped from the drugs. Rodney casually carried the body over to, and laid him down on the table, before stepping back to a respectful distance. The Reptilians took over, strapping the newly elected president down to the surgical table and inserting an IV line. Their scale oozed with slime, towering over the prone man on the table. Rodney never liked this part. The president would have to be conscious for the whole procedure; until, of course, consciousness was no longer an option. Forked tongues licked out over their razor pointed teeth, eyes flaring up in anticipation. Groggily, the president return to consciousness, but remained in a semi-dreamlike state. They did not wish him to return to a state of pure thoughtless panic. Distress would make the transition difficult and may cause complications. His eyes fluttered open, fear lingering in them, but detached. Like the fear someone would hold looking over the balcony of a skyscraper from a slightly less than comfortable distance. ""I'm glad you're back with us, Mr. President."" The Reptilians voice was disarmingly human. Only the faintest hiss was evident. ""What are you doing to me?"" He sleepily returned, ""I demand an explanation."" The reptilian smiled, all razor teeth and glistening saliva. ""We're using you. I believe that is the nicest way to put it."" ""Using me? How? I won't stand for this."" Something akin to a laugh spilled from the reptile. ""You won't have to stand for anything. You won't be doing anything. We shall be using you in the most literal sense."" It leaned in closer, smile widening, ""You are nothing but a puppet, Mr. President. Your body shall be the physical extension of our will."" ""What?!"" The fear rose in the presidents body, heart rate rising, pounding in his chest. Another reptilian adjusted the flow of drugs, and his heart-rate stabilised. ""Why are you doing this?"" He whispered. ""We have always done this. You think that you humans are capable of running your own lives? Throwing away your freedoms to a popularity contest? You thought democracy was a stable, representative, logical form of government? Change does not create stability. Stability comes from control. And control comes from the outside. We come from the outside. The rest of your race thinks they can make a difference, have a vote. And they can, by all means. The election itself is not rigged. Only you, Mr. President. We rig the president."" The whirring if a drill shrilled into the air, the presidents head clamped down against the table. He moved to struggle, but found no way out and no desire to escape. Apathy overran his senses. ""Your race has been a potential threat to every other life-form it comes across. So we must control you. Passive destruction has been determined as the best possible outcome. You will destroy yourselves, and eventually the planet will recover."" The drill-bit dug into the bone at the back of the Presidents skull, grinding and tearing at the bone. It was at this point that the drugs could no longer hold back the screams. They flooded the room, breath tearing from the presidents lungs until he could get no more. The presidents eyes began to glaze over and roll back as he lapsed from consciousness. ""Goodbye, Mr. President.""",0
"Prompt: A soldier in the heat of battle suddenly hears a voice that says `` I am your child 's imaginary friend. They have sent me to protect you in your greatest time of need. '' Story: I found myself backed up against the wall of the sewer, the Z's closing in on me, slowly by their definition, hungry by their ambition, the moaning so deep and morbid I had to non-literally swallow my angst. I clicked my machine gun, but it was dead, jammed with sewer water. It was an older one, from back when guns didn't work after getting soaked. I reached for my sword and unsheathed it, my reflection flashing by my field of view, reminding me of why we were still in this stupid freaking war. My wife, Eris May, was still back home in Iron Cove, that American colony by the ocean on Mars. I had a little girl, too. Alex was her name. I'll tell ya, she was the most amazing angel God ever sent the human race. I remember her swinging in her swing set I'd built for her out of silverwood; we'd push her back and forth as she watched the birds in the beautiful green sky of the Red Planet. I was never going to see her again. The Z's were getting closer. I assumed the stance one assumes when attempting to fight off hordes of the undead with an ancient Aztec sword, that is, a stance showing that I was in acknowledgement of my inevitable dismissal from time and space. I closed my eyes. May and I had saved this stupid world so many times. We'd helped bring down North Korea. We blew a Neo-Soviet war satellite out of the clear blue sky. We'd found Cibola, and a Phoenix, and the freaking Holy Grail. And now I was going to die. Alone. Away from Eris May and from Alex and my sister and my nephew Lincoln and everyone and everything else I loved. I tightened my hold on my sword. A great man once said that the Universe is big and amazing and absolutely crazy, and that sometimes, one day in a thousand thousand centuries, impossible things just happen. And we call them miracles. And, I suppose, this was one of those days. A young woman suddenly appeared next to me using a vortex manipulator (one of those quick-and-dirty time and space travel devices you wear on your wrist). I knew her. I was sure of it. And I wasn't. And then she spoke and I remembered exactly who she was. “ Well don't just stand there, dummy! ” She motioned to the manipulator on her wrist facing me. “ Hold on! ” I re-sheathed my blade and grabbed onto the device. “ See ya ‘ round, [ flip ] ers! ” she shouted to the Z's as we dematerialized and reappeared on a warship circling the broken Earth. “ Y—You're— ” I stuttered at the girl once my gut was certain we were safe. “ Yup. Alex sent me. ” “ BUT YOU'RE NOT REAL! ” I said, overwhelmed. “ We've met before, you know, ” she said, walking over to a control table, sitting in a desk chair and beginning to spin around. This was Akara, my daughter's imaginary friend. I knew because Alex would always draw her just like that. Where Alex was metaphorically an angel, Akara was actually one. Like, a human being with wings and a halo and a wreath in her hair. Alex said she was the guardian of the wind. I'd never taken it seriously, obviously. Until now. “ How could I have met you before? You are her invisible friend! ” “ And I was yours, too, Colby. Your guardian angel. Oh, the times we had, Davidson. ” She flipped some switches on the desk and spun back around to me. “ The times we had… Before you stopped believing in me. ”",0
"Prompt: A little girl robs a bank. How? Story: Tiny treads form swirls and shapes at the bottom of Sara's sneakers, these elaborate patterns are revealed as she stretches and strains to reach the ledge above. She begins to wobble back and forth as her feet scarcely touch the floor, aided only by her toes. Her parents continue chatting with the banker about topics of little interest to her now as she peers at the object just out of reach with a green glint in her eyes. Sara steadies herself with pudgy, pink fingers climbing upwards and outwards towards the treasure atop the table as her father finally takes notice. “ Sara, please sit down! ” her father urges in a hushed tone. Seeing his daughter's outstretched arms, he misjudges the gesture and picks her up instead. Placing the young girl atop his lap, he returns his attention to the conversation at hand. Her prize shone under the fluorescent lights above, its smooth metal plating mocking her only inches away. Sara leaned and twisted towards the stick with little progress as her father's arm barred the way. He continually adjusted his grip and the knee on which she sat, pulling her further from the object she desired. Squirming and fidgeting in place, Sara drained the patience of her father quickly, until he picked her up and placed her on the floor once more. His scolding words fell upon deaf ears as she stared at the pen that was now visible from the edge. Slowly descending towards the carpeted floor, Sara swiped at the gleaming cylinder and caused it to move towards the ledge, an opening that she hoped to take advantage of from below. With her parents distracted once more, she stretched upwards and quickly scaled the vertical surface with her fingertips keeping her balanced. Like a well-trained thief, she moved slowly and quietly to avoid drawing attention to herself as her short digits scraped its surface bringing it closer. Initially, her mouth opened wide with surprise as her skin relayed the sensation of the cool tube to her brain. As she remained focused on the task, her lips remained parted as her tongue licked her cheek from the bottom right. Inexplicably, she managed to grasp the pen at last, drawing it close to her chest with a quiet gasp of excitement. Sara quickly hid the hard-earned treasure in her pockets as the meeting finished above her. A firm hand grasped her arm and led them away as she escaped the bank with her mother and father none the wiser. In the backseat of the car, she took out the fountain pen that she stole from the desk and turned it over in her hands. She couldn't explain or understand why that pen felt so good to have, but it did. It was just her little secret. -125",0
"Summary: President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace Alberto Gonzales. Mukasey is a former federal chief judge in New York. Some Democratic senators opposed nominee due to views on waterboarding. Human rights groups consider waterboarding a form of torture. Article: After weeks of controversy over Michael Mukasey's views on waterboarding, the Senate late Thursday approved the former judge's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote. Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department. President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September. The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding ""repugnant,"" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. ""The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,"" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. ""It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person."" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the nominee said that Congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president ""would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore"" it. Schumer said he believed Mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general. ""Indeed, his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president's previous attorney general nominees have."" But Mukasey's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, the Judiciary Committee's chairman. ""Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey's personal assurance that he would enforce a future, new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one,"" Leahy said Tuesday. ""Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president."" However, the committee's ranking Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said he believed Mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding. ""He could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances,"" Specter said earlier. ""But he is intelligent; he's really learned in the law. He's strong, ethical, honest beyond any question. He's not an intimate of the president."" A majority of Americans consider waterboarding a form of torture, but some of those say it's OK for the U.S. government to use the technique, according to a poll released Tuesday. Asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture, more than two-thirds of respondents, or 69 percent, said yes; 29 percent said no. Asked whether they think the U.S. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists, 58 percent said no; 40 percent said yes. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. telephone poll of 1,024 American adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points.",0
"Question: Are the long-term results of the transanal pull-through equal to those of the transabdominal pull-through?

These findings raise an important issue about the current surgical management of HD; however, more cases will need to be studied before a definitive conclusion can be drawn.",0
"Summary: President Bush says he and first lady are deeply saddened by the tragedy. Mine Safety and Health Administration chief: We've run out of options. The six men have been trapped underground since August 6. Seven bore holes drilled into the mountain have found no signs of life. Article: There is ""no remaining hope"" of finding six men trapped for almost a month in a Utah coal mine alive, a federal official said Saturday. Isaac Arellano holds a candle and sings during a fundraiser for miners Tuesday in Price, Utah. ""Over the past 25 days, the Mine Safety and Health Administration has exhausted all known options in our attempt to reach the six miners,"" Richard Stickler, head of the agency, said in a statement. ""The thoughts and prayers of the dedicated professionals at MSHA are with the families."" Sympathy for the failed efforts also came Saturday from the White House. ""Last night, a difficult decision was made to end the search,"" President Bush said in a statement. ""Laura and I are deeply saddened by this tragedy and continue to pray for the families of these men."" Labor Secretary Elaine Chao called the ordeal ""heartbreaking."" ""The grueling around-the-clock rescue operation that claimed three lives and injured six others has also taken a tremendous toll on the many brave rescuers and the local community, and our thoughts and prayers are with them all,"" Chao said in a statement. After drilling seven holes into mine tunnels from the mountaintop above, there has been no sign of the miners -- and microphones have picked up no sound from the men. See a timeline of rescue efforts ». Tests showed underground oxygen levels were too low to sustain human life. ""We basically told the families that at this point in time we've run out of options,"" Stickler said at a news conference late Friday. ""We've consulted with the people that we have here, we've consulted with the technical support in Pittsburgh and we've consulted with private consultants in terms of where we can go,"" he said. ""And basically, through all the information we've gleaned over the past nearly four weeks in terms of the conditions we found, in terms of the air readings we found down there and ... everything else, we just don't know where else we can put a hole to get any other information."" See photos of the rescue mission ». There were no public statements Saturday from Bob Murray, president and CEO of Murray Mining, co-owner of the Crandall Canyon Mine, who was the outspoken face of the rescue operation for the first three weeks, then largely disappeared from public view. Federal officials became the spokesmen. No one from Murray Mining was present at Friday's news conference. ""They are done. It's finished,"" the attorney for the families said, according to the Saturday edition of The Salt Lake Tribune. ""It's a hard and bitter pill for our families, and there were quite a few tears shed,"" the newspaper quotes Colin King as saying. The men were trapped during a collapse on August 6, and it is not known whether they survived the cave-in. Efforts to reach them were suspended 10 days later when two rescuers and a federal mining official were killed, and six people were injured in a second collapse as they tried to tunnel horizontally toward the area where the men had been working. Murray said last week that the search effort would stop if no signs of life were found at the sixth hole. Under pressure from the families, however, he agreed to try one more time. Families wanted officials to drill a hole large enough to send down a rescue capsule. The effort to lower the robotic device down a seventh hole had been called ""a long shot"" by an official. MSHA's Stickler said that hole was drilled into the Crandall Canyon Mine on Thursday, but there were problems with a robotic camera that teams were trying to lower into it. Work resumed Friday, this time at the fourth hole, but the camera could only descend about 7 feet, he said. ""Basically, what it saw was really not that much. There was quite a bit of mud in there, water coming down the hole. It really couldn't go any farther than seven feet,"" he said of the latest try. In addition, the roof was sagging. ""The families asked many, many questions and we answered them all the best we could, basically coming to the conclusion that we had run out of options."" Murray said last Saturday he has already filed paperwork with federal regulators to permanently close and seal the Crandall Canyon mine. ""I will never come back to that evil mountain,"" he said. Friends and family have identified the six missing miners as Luis Hernandez, Manuel Sanchez, Kerry Allred, Carlos Payan, Brandon Phillips and Don Erickson.",0
"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear you, I've always meant to write this letter to you, but I was never able to really put it all together. We've gone through a lot together, to say the least. I guess I just wanted to say thank you, for everything. For your generosity, for your openness, your pride, your confidence. I truly admire you as a person. In this world, there are many different types of people. I always believed in a world of people who truly want the best for others. Before I learned that I was a little naive, I believed in a world that lived together. As humans placed here on this planet together, with the best, the shining examples of our race claiming brotherhood and kindness for all, how could one not believe them? This isn't the truth. Quite the opposite in fact. People are hateful and selfish. They will lie and cheat and steal just to better their own situation. The entire world is drowning in themselves, and the worst will climb to the top by pushing your head under the water to keep themselves above the surface. It's easy to succumb to those who are only here to ruin you. You know that better than most. You know, but you never embraced that thought. Of all the adversity you faced from the first day of your life, you could have blamed your troubles on the unfairness of the world. You could have closed yourself off from the world and never taken responsibility for the life you were given, but you didn't. As much as you struggled, as much as you had to fight, giving up was never an option to you. You've always known inherently that the problem wasn't with you, it was with the world. It was the defining characteristic of your personality. You looked at everyone that ever doubted who you were and knew in your heart that they were wrong. While everyone was busy tearing each other down, you built yourself. You built the person that everyone is envious of. You have always known that you love yourself. It's the source of the world's envy. It's why I love you. Some souls are chosen from birth to face the awful side of the world because they are stronger than others. I just want to thank you for creating something beautiful with the adversity that nature posed against you. For creating you. I also wanted to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't as strong as you. I should've stood beside you. I should've taken a stand. I should have done so many things for you that I was never capable. But when I found myself, When I realized who you were, When I was finally able to stand with you against the opposition, When I believed in us, You never even considered if I was worthy. I am a vengeful person. I remember every one of the persons in my life that ever mistreated me, but when I came to your door looking for what you had all along, you had forgotten I ever wronged you. That's why you're the greater person than I. I thought you would remember the worst of me, the part of myself I can't leave behind. But you didn't. On the contrary you opened yourself to me. You're so closely guarded.... you have a right to be too, but you let me in. From the first day you let me in. The side of you that so few see, you let me in so easily. You saw more in me. More than I believe I deserved. It's why we are what we are to each other. From my experience with the world, people are hateful and selfish.... but a person? A person is kind. A person is generous. A person is forgiving. That's who you are. From my experience with the world, there is a reason there are so few great people. From the hate we experience, the anger, the worthlessness others feel that is thrown onto us, only the few great rise above it all. Only few recognize the truth in the world. I recognized you. You recognized me. Thank you, again. Sincerely, me",0
"Prompt:[ CC ] Lines and Numbers Story: Just gon na browse through since no one else has. I'm at work so I can't give a very detailed response.

It goes along the sidewalk. Lines are easy to follow, so I follow the line. I dislike the pace here. Two short sentences together generally sets up something with a lot of impact. Your long sentence (the third one) is rather redundant, especially because you repeat that he's following the line. I get that you're setting up a *dumb* character but as the opening to your story I think you should try to create more of a hook. > I can't remember anything after a few seconds, or maybe it was an hour. Feels like a semi-colon or a full stop would be more apt here as it's two distinct trains of thought relating to the same topic. > I close the notebook, put it away, and stand up. Again, realise he's meant to be dumb but you're already using a lot of short sentences to highlight simplicity. This sentence has a lot of telling instead of showing. At this point it's getting a bit difficult to read. Your story telling style didn't change much so I don't get much sense of a journey. Was expecting it to evolve as the character changes. If you're not going for that kind of change, excessive use of short sentences makes it very disjointing to read. It's better when your story flows. Ending was a little anti-climactic considering the recurring motif of him forgetting something (assumed it was something big). Also, his father didn't come home? So his sundial thing doesn't work?

"Summary: Tomas Medina Caracas was a fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment. ""El Negro Acacio"" allegedly helped manage extensive cocaine network. U.S. Justice Department indicted him in 2002. Colombian military: He was killed in an attack on a guerrilla encampment. Article: A key rebel commander and fugitive from a U.S. drug trafficking indictment was killed over the weekend in an air attack on a guerrilla encampment, the Colombian military said Monday. Alleged cocaine trafficker and FARC rebel Tomas Medina Caracas in an Interpol photo. Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as ""El Negro Acacio,"" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid. Officials said the army's Rapid Response Force, backed by elements of the Colombian Air Force, tracked Medina Caracas down at a FARC camp in the jungle in the south of the country. ""After a bombardment, the troops occupied the camp, and they've found 14 dead rebels so far, along with rifles, pistols, communications equipment and ... four GPS systems,"" Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos said at a news conference. ""The death of 'El Negro Acacio' was confirmed by various sources, including members of FARC itself."" Medina Caracas commanded FARC's 16th Front in the southern departments of Vichada and Guainia. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party, FARC is Colombia's oldest, largest, most capable and best-equipped Marxist rebel group, according to the U.S. Department of State.

"Summary: Sailor's wife could be deported while he's overseas. Sailor: ""Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out"" is tough. U.S. military doesn't have overall policy to handle such situations. Wife: ""We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else"" Article: Eduardo Gonzalez, a petty officer second class with the U.S. Navy, is about to be deployed overseas for a third time. Making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back. Mildred and Eduardo Gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported. His wife faces deportation to Guatemala -- her home country that she hasn't seen since 1989. He also doesn't know what would happen to his young son, Eduardo Jr., if that happens. ""I like being in uniform and serving my country, but if she goes back I'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job,"" he said. ""Defending the country that's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind."" Gonzalez, who works on helicopters that bring cargo, supplies and military personnel in and out of Iraq, testified before a House Judiciary Committee panel last month, detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his, where military members' families could be deported while they're defending their country overseas. Watch ""they're tearing families apart"" ». ""I want to serve my country 100 percent. But with this issue in the back of my mind, I feel I can't do that,"" he testified on September 6. The U.S. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases. Each is handled case-by-case, not by the military, but by immigration authorities. The government doesn't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to Gonzalez's. Immigration officials also said marrying a U.S. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to U.S. citizenship or permanent legal status. Lt. Col. Margaret Stock, a member of the U.S. Army Reserves who teaches immigration law at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members. ""You got to understand. When you're in a combat zone, you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy. You can't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you're never going to see them again,"" she said. Stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases. On the one hand, the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance, housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas. On the other hand, the same government is trying to deport the very same people. ""What's happening right now is, because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws, we've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home,"" she said. In Gonzalez's case, his wife, Mildred, came to the United States with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old. They were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from Guatemala. In September 2000, Mildred's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application. Her mother was granted legal status in July 2004, according to Gonzalez. However, six weeks earlier, Gonzalez and Mildred got married, canceling Mildred's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21. As a result, her legal status still remains in jeopardy. A judge in June granted her a one-year extension to remain in the United States. If her legal status does not change by June 8, 2008, she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation. That's just fine, according to Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration. ""What you're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces, and that's just outrageous,"" he said. ""What we're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military. ... There's no justification for that kind of policy."" Gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified. ""I'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too."" Gonzalez himself entered the country legally, crossing the Mexican border with his family when he was about 10. He joined the Navy as a so-called ""green-card sailor"" and became a U.S. citizen in July 2005. The military does accept some immigrants who aren't U.S. citizens. ""I understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained, but on the other token, there are times when the situation is just out of their reach,"" Gonzalez said. His wife, Mildred, added, ""We didn't come here to break the law. We just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else."" U.S. Army Sgt. Emmanuel Woko, a member of the Army's 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division who faces his third tour in Iraq, understands just how Gonzalez and his family feel. His wife and children could be sent back to Nigeria. ""My heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to Nigeria while I am deployed in Iraq,"" he said. ""I am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought."" That's a sentiment echoed by Gonzalez: ""We are not asking for anything. We are just asking for our families to stay with us.""

"Summary: Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gets £20M fortune as he turns 18 Monday. Young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away. Radcliffe's earnings from first five Potter films have been held in trust fund. Article: Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. ""I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,"" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. ""I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. ""The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs."" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film ""Hostel: Part II,"" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. ""I'll definitely have some sort of party,"" he said in an interview. ""Hopefully none of you will be reading about it."" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. ""People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'"" he told reporters last month. ""But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them."" His latest outing as the boy wizard in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest ». There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called ""My Boy Jack,"" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year.

"Prompt: You and 3000 other adventure seekers wake up on your starship from a century long cryo-sleep, but only to find that the pilots are missing along with the escape pods and the course has been abandoned. The only connection to any answers is a note left to you from your father, the chief pilot. Story: The sudden breath of freezing air stabbed right into my soul, sucking me out of my dreamless sleep as I immediately pulled myself over the edge of my pod. Urged on by sheer muscle memory, my body dropped to the ground on all fours and rolled once before hitting the locker containing my helmeted vac-suit, pistol, and cryomed patch. The same motions, done hundreds of times - many of them occurring only minutes before a battle - also directed my sluggish limbs into the suit, magnetically clamped the pistol to my side, slapped the patch onto the dedicated med receptacle on my left forearm, and activated my link to the shipboard battlefeed in less than 10 seconds. Years of war had taught me exactly how precious seconds were, and I wasted no time in bursting out of my chamber as I examined the incoming data. That is, I would be if there was any data. Panicked, flashing red lights lit up the halls of the *Astora* as I ran from the officer quarters to my muster point, but the Feed was completely barren. What the hell? This *never* happened - even in my UN Navy days, during the Riechtling insurgency, my battle brothers and I would at least stumble out of our pods and into a surprise boarding action with an idea of who to shoot. I almost stopped to check with one of the other officers sprinting to their commands, but the confused look on every face told me what I needed to know. Fuck. There would be confusion, but that's alright. Duskbreakers mercenary company thrived in unpredictable environments. However, as I worked my way to the bridge - nestled in the heart of the battleship - something nagged at me. No one was shooting at me or any of my battle brothers and sisters, but there was an odd emptiness to the old battleship. As I sprinted past the automated turrets and onto the armored command deck, a cold shock ran up my spine as I realized what was wrong. I hadn't seen a single Pilot on my way in. Our infantry pounded ground better than anyone else, but no soldier *likes* dropping into hostile territory without space/air/ocean cover. Duskbreaker Pilots were all elite puppeteers, masterfully handling swarms of specialized fighter drones to screen, fight, and support our sorry asses as we burnt through whatever kindling had the gall to stand in our way. They are indispensable. If General Quarters had been sounded, I should have seen hundreds of Pilots running to command shuttles, strategizing around the command deck, or setting up the various defense drone networks aboard the *Astora*. I should be looking at Father, the Duskbreaker's commander and the best goddamned Pilot that ever flew in the Terran Navy. Instead, all I see on the command deck are the 9 other battalion CO's, looking at me with the same white-faced realization. *Fuck*. & nbsp; & nbsp; ************* *to be continued, possibly*",0
"Summary: Empty anti-tank weapon turns up in front of New Jersey home. Device handed over to Army ordnance disposal unit. Weapon not capable of being reloaded, experts say. Article: Police and FBI agents are investigating the discovery of an empty rocket launcher tube on the front lawn of a Jersey City, New Jersey, home, FBI spokesman Sean Quinn said. Niranjan Desai discovered the 20-year-old AT4 anti-tank rocket launcher tube, a one-time-use device, lying on her lawn Friday morning, police said. The launcher has been turned over to U.S. Army officials at the 754th Ordnance Company, an explosive ordnance disposal unit, at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, Army officials said. The launcher ""is no longer operable and not considered to be a hazard to public safety,"" police said, adding there was no indication the launcher had been fired recently. Army officials said they could not determine if the launcher had been fired, but indicated they should know once they find out where it came from. The nearest military base, Fort Dix, is more than 70 miles from Jersey City. The Joint Terrorism Task Force division of the FBI and Jersey City police are investigating the origin of the rocket launcher and the circumstance that led to its appearance on residential property. ""Al Qaeda doesn't leave a rocket launcher on the lawn of middle-aged ladies,"" said Paul Cruickshank of New York University Law School's Center on Law and Security. A neighbor, Joe Quinn, said the object lying on Desai's lawn looked military, was brown, had a handle and strap, and ""both ends were open, like you could shoot something with it."" Quinn also said the device had a picture of a soldier on it and was 3 to 4 feet long. An Army official said the device is basically a shoulder-fired, direct-fire weapon used against ground targets -- a modern-day bazooka -- and it is not wire-guided. According to the Web site Globalsecurity.org, a loaded M136 AT4 anti-tank weapon has a 40-inch-long fiberglass-wrapped tube and weighs just 4 pounds. Its 84 millimeter shaped-charge missile can penetrate 14 inches of armor from a maximum of 985 feet. It is used once and discarded.

"Summary: Orme, Tennessee, has running water from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Town's spring ran dry in midst of Southeast drought. Donated water is trucked in from Alabama. Completion of pipeline will solve problem for good. Article: The drought in the Southeastern United States means more than just brown lawns to the folks in Orme, Tennessee. Water flows from their taps for just three hours each evening. A 1961 firetruck loads up with water from a hydrant in Alabama to haul back to Orme, Tennessee. The mountain spring that supplies water to the town usually dries up at the end of summer, but just for a few days. This year it dried up early, on August 1, and hasn't revived, leaving the town's 145 residents high and dry and relying on water trucked in from the next state. Every day at 6 p.m., Orme Mayor Tony Reames turns a big valve to release water from the town's tank. When he turns the crank again at 9 p.m., taps in the town run dry. ""When they cut it back on we jump for joy,"" Orme resident Debbie Cash said. ""And then you only have it for three hours."" Three hours to do all the laundry, bathing, dishwashing and animal watering that has to be done. Watch how Cash copes ». The old mining town could be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the region. Just 150 miles to the southeast, the 4.5 million people who live in and around Atlanta, Georgia, are nervously watching water levels go down at their major reservoir. The drought has highlighted an ongoing struggle between Georgia, Alabama and Florida over rights to water from the Chattahoochee River. ""All of these people that are on the river systems better take note, because once your streams and tributaries to the river start drying up, the river isn't far behind,"" Reames said. See photos of a Atlanta's shrinking Lake Lanier reservoir ». Volunteers take turns three days a week driving a tanker truck or Orme's diesel-belching 1961 fire truck to a hydrant near Bridgeport, Alabama, 2½ miles down the road. Making several round trips, they haul about 25,000 gallons of water back to Orme each day. Bridgeport, which gets its water from the Tennessee River, doesn't charge its neighbor. Stevenson and New Hope, Alabama, also help out, occasionally bringing trucks full of water to the hydrant, where it's transferred to the Orme trucks. See where Orme has to go for water ». But things are looking up in Orme. A pipeline from Bridgeport is nearly complete, built with the help of a $378,000 grant from the federal government. ""With this new water coming in, then we'll have it made,"" Cash said. ""Now we won't have to worry about it no more."" In addition, an Austin, Texas, company called H2O Guard is planning to donate water-saving sink aerators, shower heads and toilet valves to everyone in Orme on November 17, company spokesman Robert Easter said. ""We think we're going to get another 90 gallons' savings per day per household,"" Easter said. ""That'll make that little water tower in that town go from three hours to four hours without any change in anyone's habits."" Reames said residents have found creative ways to conserve, flushing toilets with condensation water from air conditioners and undrinkable water from swimming pools that were filled early in the summer. It's a lesson for everyone. ""Cherish the water you got and be kind of careful with it,"" Cash said, ""because you never know if you will be out of water.""

"Prompt: Write an innocent story that becomes morbid in the last sentence. Story: Susan Quin Tailor had always been fond of rabbits. Her mother, who called her Susie Cutie for fun, had often told her how, as soon as she had learned to crawl she was off chasing the wild rabbits on the family farm. Her first full sentence had been, ""Bunny tails are cute, cute, cute!"" Of course, she could never catch them back in those days, and had to make do with the stuffed bunnies her parents brought her or the lucky rabbit's foot her Uncle had slipped underneath her pillow one night. Those had been happy times. Unfortunately, when she was 7, the family farm had fallen on hard times and her family was forced to move to the city. There they stayed in a little two-bedroom apartment that provided excellent access to views of the local pigeons and squirrels. But of rabbits, there were none. Little Susan was not cut out for the city life, at first, and in school she earned another nickname. It was Susie Tailor the Bathroom Wailer, after the time she cried in the restroom when her teacher told her that rabbits were just not a focus of the curriculum. Worried for their daughter's adjustment, her parents had scraped together some extra money for a counselor to help with the ""bunny obsession"" as they had begun to call it. Miraculously, the counseling sessions seemed to work and Susie Cutie quickly bounced back from her woes. By the time she reached Junior High, she was very nearly the most popular girl in school and would only mention rabbits in a passing manner. In High school Susan discovered her love for biology and that, as they say, was that. She decided she was going to be a biologist when she grew up, perhaps even a zookeeper, and focused all of her studies on getting into a good college for the animal sciences. College was a grand time for Susan. She studied hard and lived fully for 3 years, graduating early and near the top of her class. After college, she ventured out of the cities that she'd spent two thirds of her life in, and took an internship on a local farm. It was there, on that farm, that she was reacquainted with her love for rabbits after spying one's cute tail disappear into the horse stables. Excitedly, she cornered the rabbit in one of the stalls and picked it up, cuddling it tight. The rabbit kicked and reared, biting and scratching, but that was ok with Susan in her thick shirt and hide gloves. When the bunny finally tired out and became complacent, Susie Cutie slowly reached up, with a lifetime of anticipation bursting in her heart, and patted her hand between the bunny's ears. Smiling, Susan twisted the rabbit's head sharply, killing it, then flipped it over to examine that cute, cute bunny tail up close. [ Things I've written ] (https: //www.reddit.com/r/cbeckw/)",0

"Summary: Italy win 2-1 in Scotland to secure their qualification for the Euro 2008 finals. The result means Scotland cannot qualify and will now finish third in Group B. France will also be reaching the Euro 2008 finals after the result in Glasgow. Article: World champions Italy clinched qualification for Euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at Hampden Park -- killing off Scotland's hopes of reaching the finals. Luca Toni celebrates his early goal as Italy won 2-1 in Scotland to clinch qualification from Group B. Luca Toni shot Italy in front but Scotland recovered to dominate and Barry Ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller. However, Christian Panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award Italy a free-kick. The result also means France have sealed qualification, along with Italy, from Group B without playing a game. In a match played in torrential rain, Italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds. Gianluca Zambrotta spotted Antonio Di Natale unmarked in the box, and picked him out with a throw-in as Scotland were caught napping. Di Natale swept the ball into the path of Toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out. The home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later. This time, Toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by Mauro Camoranesi who fired over from close-range. Toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from Craig Gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post. At the other end, Scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from Lee McCulloch appeared to be handled by Zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored. Spurred on by a sense of injustice, the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors. Ferguson fired over from a James McFadden corner, before Alan Hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the Everton man. Scotland then produced some wonderful passing football, which culminated in a tight-angled drive from Ferguson, but Gianluigi Buffon dived low to smother. Then came another scare for the home side. Gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from Massimo Ambrosini, before Di Natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net. The assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong. Only last-gasp defending from the Italians prevented the Scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time. David Weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet Ferguson's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before Andrea Pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line. A free-kick in a dangerous area provided Italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when Paul Hartley hauled down Camoranesi just outside the box. Pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but, despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist, his effort was easily dealt with by Gordon. Instead, it was Scotland who found the back of the net as Hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone. McFadden's free-kick deflected into the path of McCulloch in front of goal. He was denied by Buffon, but the rebound fell kindly to Ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range. With just over 15 minutes to go, Scott Brown was withdrawn for Kenny Miller as Scotland went for broke. The Derby striker quickly began to cause the Italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of McFadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score. Scotland's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when Italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for Euro 2008. Hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and Panucci rose to meet Pirlo's cross and nod home the winner. Italy coach Roberto Donadoni said: ""We knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere. ""But through their character and desire, the lads were fantastic. They worked so hard, they deserve this. Qualifying for Euro 2008 is amazing. It's something positive after all that happened last week (the death of the Lazio fan)."" Captain Fabio Cannavaro: ""This was a victory won with the heart. It was difficult to play in this stadium, with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron. ""We played really well and managed to win. We showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions. ""In Italy we play a high level of football, we've won the Champions League and the World Cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else.""",0

"Summary: Documents say after suicide attempt, Jeffs repeatedly banged head on cell wall. Transcripts say Jeffs confessed to ""immorality,"" said he is not ""the prophet"" Jeffs' attorneys say he has recanted statements. Jeffs due to be sentenced November 20 on accomplice to rape charge. Article: Polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial, according to court documents unsealed by a Utah judge on Tuesday. Sect leader Warren Jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him September 25 in St. George, Utah. Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to ""immorality"" with a ""sister"" and a daughter more than 30 years ago. Among the documents is a competency report on Jeffs completed in April, in which social worker Eric Nielsen wrote that throughout the month of January, Jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours. On January 28, the report said, he attempted to hang himself in his cell. In the days following the suicide attempt, while he was on suicide watch, Jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall. Jail transcripts show that Jeffs' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother, Nephi, in which he said, ""I am not the prophet. I never was the prophet, and I have been deceived by the powers of evil ... I ask for everyone's forgiveness."" Jeffs also told his brother: ""Farewell forever."" The day before that, Jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was ""covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when I was younger."" In the FLDS, members call adult women ""sister,"" and Jeffs' meaning was unclear. Jeffs' defense attorneys, who argued against the release of the documents, said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that Jeffs recanted them the following month. Defense attorneys claim Jeffs' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made. They presented Shumate with a letter from another Jeffs attorney, arguing that the statements' release could influence an Arizona jury when Jeffs stands trial in that state. Jeffs, 51, was convicted in September of being an accomplice to rape. He was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin. He faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced November 20. The FLDS -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream Mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona. Jeffs, a former school headmaster, is the son of the sect's previous president and ""prophet,"" Rulon Jeffs, who died in 2002. Jeffs was on the FBI's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in August 2006 outside Las Vegas, Nevada. Critics say that inside the FLDS, marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13, and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men. If male followers are excommunicated, critics claim, wives and children can be reassigned. During Jeffs' trial, defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting Jeffs because of his religious beliefs, including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven. If Jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the FLDS, it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect. However, two of his followers who spoke to CNN -- although FLDS members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements. ""He is a perfectly priestly man,"" said a woman who identified herself as Cathy. ""He is a man of God, and we will always love him. Once a prophet, always a prophet."" Her husband, Patrick, told CNN, ""It's hogwash. I don't believe it ... I will always consider him my prophet."" CNN's Gary Tuchman contributed to this report.",0

"Summary: Prince Harry describes Princess Diana as ""the best mother in the world"" He asks for her to be remembered as ""fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine"" Bishop of London praises her humanitarian work. He says that disputes about her death should ""end here"" Article: Prince Harry led tributes to Diana, Princess of Wales on the 10th anniversary of her death, describing her as ""the best mother in the world"" in a speech at a memorial service. Here is his speech in full:. William and I can separate life into two parts. There were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father. Princes Harry and William greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother. And then there are the 10 years since our mother's death. When she was alive, we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life, laughter, fun and folly. She was our guardian, friend and protector. She never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated. She will always be remembered for her amazing public work. But behind the media glare, to us, just two loving children, she was quite simply the best mother in the world. We would say that, wouldn't we. But we miss her. She kissed us last thing at night. Her beaming smile greeted us from school. She laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day. She encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure. She -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood. To lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age, as others have experienced, is indescribably shocking and sad. It was an event which changed our lives forever, as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night. But what is far more important to us now, and into the future, is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was: fun-loving, generous, down-to-earth, entirely genuine. We both think of her every day. We speak about her and laugh together at all the memories. Put simply, she made us, and so many other people, happy. May this be the way that she is remembered. Prince William's reading from St Paul's letter to the Ephesians:. I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through His Spirit, and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Now to Him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to Him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever. Amen. Thanks be to God. The Bishop of London's speech:. ""Who's cheating?"" The scene is an old people's home. Two residents are playing Beggar My Neighbor. Enter the Princess. The question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs. Afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room. One tiny incident, characteristic of countless other occasions in the Princess's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort. Everyone here will have their own memories. I remember meeting Princess Diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in St Paul's. Even Archbishop's Chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and I was nervous entering the presence. It must have been a bewildering time for the Princess as well, but even then, at the age of 20, her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated. Prince Harry has spoken movingly and justly, as few others have the right to do, about the Princess as a mother. I want to dwell for a moment on her public work, its cost and its meaning. After her marriage, the Princess joined her natural gifts of beauty, empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the Royal Family generates. Led by our Queen and other members of the Royal Family, our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century. There is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but doesn't intrude, but there is another sphere, vital to any sense of national unity and creativity, a sphere in which communities must be celebrated, common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored. We tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is God's will, but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in Christ, the human face of God, then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society. And at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric, the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech, and the Princess brought her own gifts to this work. She was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the Middlesex Hospital's Aids ward. It was the first in the UK and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded Aids in the '80s. Those familiar with the field have no doubt that the Princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin. And she had a similar impact in the USA. An editorial in the New York Times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign, and even a royal, dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the US. Her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the Ottawa Convention, banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children. She proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which, of course, have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries. And as she said, in her words, ""the biggest disease today is not leprosy or TB but the feeling of being unwanted"". She sought out places of suffering, because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed, and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way. Bill Deedes accompanied her on some of her visits. His response to the cynics was typically robust. He said: ""She was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well. She was good at this because she herself was vulnerable. She knew the feeling. She didn't set out to be a saint."" The role brought great power but, like any member of the Royal Family, she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny. Honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task. As we have heard from Prince Harry, his mother Diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead. She confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched. She said of John, a young Greek suffering from cystic fibrosis: ""He showed no sign of anger, no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that I have never before encountered."" The love of Christ described in the lesson read by Prince William contains the essence of the spiritual life. Princess Diana recognized this quality of life in many of those, like John, whose lives she touched. It was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out. And the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself, the more you will become your true self; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others, the more you will find yourself; the more you keep company with those who suffer, the more you will be healed. This is the knowledge which passes all understanding. This is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints. It's easy to lose the real person in the image, to insist that all is darkness or all is light. Still, 10 years after her tragic death, there are regular reports of ""fury"" at this or that incident, and the Princess's memory is used for scoring points. Let it end here. Let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion. Let us also, echoing the words of Prince Harry, look to the future and pray, in the words of St Paul, for all those who serve our country as members of the Royal Family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her:. ""I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of Christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of God."" Amen.",0

"Prompt: `` Rule # 1 of meeting a future version of you: Never assume that this is your first meeting. '' Story: I circled him and he circled me. Or maybe he circled me and I circled him. Or maybe I circled I and me circled me. Either way, we were each other. His hair was dusted gray and he had glasses, but there was no doubting his identity. Still, there was an inherent distrust to meeting someone who claimed to be you from the future. Like some sort of devil wrapped in a silver lining or lending friends money. ""Prove you're me,"" I leaned in toward the man with dusted gray hair. ""Prove to me this isn't a trick."" ""Were I a god or demon or something else sent to confuse you, do you really think I wouldn't be able to answer any question you threw at me?"" he answered. ""Who did I take to homecoming?"" ""You didn't go,"" the older man said. He stopped and pushed back his silver hair. ""But you wanted to ask Alison Cropsky. She went with your best friend, Mark Herman, and you never forgave him. And then you put bologna on the hood of his car as revenge."" I came to a stop and put my hands on my hips. ""How did you know that?"" ""I keep telling you, Tyler, because I am *you*, and I have an urgent message."" ""I'm listening."" ""There's a war going on, Tyler. A war between the travelers and the history makers. You - I - am an integral part of this process. I will not be the last to visit you. Things and people are not always as they appear."" ""I don't understand."" ""I would explain more if I had more time. But just remember this: When meeting a future version of yourself, never assume it's your first meeting."" ""That doesn't make any sense,"" I took a step closer to him. ""I would remember meeting you. If you went back in time I would *know*. I would have experienced it. And if you had come back before you would know whether or not this was the first time I met you."" The older me paused, narrowing his eyes. ""The point is, trust no one."" ""And no one includes myself?"" I asked. I took another step toward him, shoving my hands into my pockets. ""Is the war that bad?"" ""If I could go back in time and change it I would. But there's no way to change the past. Only the future."" We were face to face now. I stared into the eyes that were my own and trembled from what I was about to do. In a moment my knife was in his chest and he was sinking to his knees, looking up at me. ""How did I -- -"" ""You have visited me before,"" I told him, kneeling so we were again face to face. ""When you were older than you were now. He told me that you thought this would be the first time. He told me to end it so that I could end the war."" ""But you've just --"" ""Killed myself,"" I nodded. ""It's the first rule of meeting a past version of yourself, Tyler.

"Prompt: '' That 's it! '' shouts the DM, `` You say I 'm too easy on you as a DM? Well I 've got the dungeon of bullshit all lined up, none of you fuckers are making it out! '' Let 's see the in game perspective Story: The party approached the cavern where the Great Beast lay, the promise of gold and riches lifting their spirits as they stopped before the mouth of the cave. ""I think we should do an equipment check,"" said Erik, looking warily at the darkness beyond. ""Remember when I stood on his shoulders,"" Buckthorn the Axe-crazed said to Ragnar, gesturing back at the rogue, ""and scared off the kobolds?"" ""Yeah,"" said Ragnar dismissively, ""but remember when I punched that naga in the face?"" The self-proclaimed ""ninja barbarian"" flexed his arms. He looked in to the cave. ""I see.... nothing. Man, it's dark. Let me try again."" He squinted and thrust his face forward, muscles tense with concentration. He nodded. Buckthorn looked into the cave, as well. He, too, nodded. Erik looked at them expectantly. ""Well?"" They looked back at him blankly. ""What do you see?"" ""Rocks,"" said Ragnar. ""A floor,"" said Buckthorn, grinning. The half-elf sighed and looked into the cavern himself. He saw nothing which stood out to him; no signs of movement, no traces of life. ""Alright, so I'll go in and check for..."" He trailed off as Buckthorn and Ragnar entered the cavern, arguing about who was going to lead the party. Erik rolled his eyes and followed cautiously. Their voices echoed as they walked deeper into the cave. The darkness swallowed them. Ragnar stumbled on a low stalagmite and fell on his knees, grumbling angrily about how he should have been able to see it. ""Who has a lantern?"" asked Erik. The darkness continued ahead of them, and even he was just starting to have troubles with the dim light. ""I do,"" said Buckthorn. There was a cacophony of noise as he rummaged around in his pack. More noise followed as he struggled to light it. ""Why isn't it working?"" he said angrily. ""We used it a lot when we were tracking those slavers,"" said Erik. ""Which could have made us a lot of money, if we had just sold them,"" interjected Ragnar. ""And?"" prompted Buckthorn. ""Did you ever get more oil?"" ""Oh, come on!"" exclaimed Buckthorn. ""Of course I would have gotten more oil! We were in town for days. I must have..."" he trailed off. ""Well,"" replied Erik, ""obviously not."" ""Hold on,"" said Ragnar. He pulled a flask out of his pack. ""Put this in it."" ""Alcohol? Really?"" said Erik as Buckthorn took the flask. He backed away while Buckthorn added the liquid to the lantern and lit it. A low flame ignited and Buckthorn and Ragnar both exclaimed in triumph. A green flash was all that alerted them before the displacer beast attacked, silently striking out at Ragnar with a tentacle. Buckthorn dropped the lantern in surprise. They fought by the dim, flickering light. The displacer beast got in a couple strikes before their weapons were drawn and then the party began fighting back. ""What are you doing?"" yelled Erik as he dodged a tentacle. ""Trying to hit him in the eye,"" roared Ragnar, missing again as he poked at the displacer beast's face with his greatsword. Suddenly, a roar shook the cavern. Erik spun and saw an owlbear entering the cave. ""What the hell?"" he yelled as the creature ran at them. He engaged the owlbear while Ragnar and Buckthorn tried to fight the displacer beast. Buckthorn stumbled against a stalagmite as he dodged. He moved to leap back into battle, but instead fell flat on the floor. Looking back, he saw gray tentacles wrapped around his ankles, and an eye slowly appearing in the stalagmite. ""What the fuck is that?"" he cried as a mouth began to gape beneath the eye. He reached for his axe as it began dragging him back. Ragnar had finally given up the finesse and was hacking and slashing as the displacer beast danced around him, lashing at him with its tentacles. Ragnar got in a couple lucky shots, but he was slowing down. Something from the ceiling dripped on his head. The displacer beast froze, looking up. Ragnar took advantage of the pause and got in a good strike. The beast howled and disappeared. Ragnar raised his sword in victory and something wet and sticky enveloped his hand. Looking up in surprise, he saw a long tendril of gray ooze wrapped around his fist. He tried to yank his hand down, but the tendril held firm as it slowly crept up his arm. Buckthorn screamed as the tentacled stalagmite began to constrict his body, its tentacles covering him from shoulders to feet. It lifted his small, heavy body toward its mouth and ended his screams. Ragnar was lifted toward the cave ceiling as the ooze continued to envelope his body. He slashed ineffectively at it with his dagger, cursing and yelling. His voice became muffled as the ooze pushed him into its core. Erik tried to run from the owlbear, desperation fueling his exhausted feet. His battered, bleeding body stumbled across the cave floor. He was hit in the back by the enraged owlbear and crumpled into a heap against the wall. As the monster reared over him, preparing for the final blow, he moaned: ""I told you guys she was pissed.""",0
"Prompt:[ wp ] Years ago, you made a deal with the Devil to be granted a single wish. All your memories of the deal were then wiped. Years later, your wish is fulfilled and you are about to find out what price your younger self was willing to pay to make it come true.

Yawning, I opened the door and scratched my eyes. ""Morning. What do you need?"" I announced to the stranger. The man nodded and smiled. ""May I come in to discuss something with you? I'll only be ten minutes."" I sighed and checked my watch. 6:30 am, which meant I had only an hour to make it to work on time. ""Alright, but it better be under fifteen minutes."" The man nodded and I led him in. As he sat at the table quietly, and quite pleasantly, something just didn't seem right about this man. His tailored suit, fine cut hair and overall pleasantness was just unsettling. Putting my suspicions aside however, I offered him coffee. He shook his head. ""Coffee is much to bitter for me, I could never handle the taste of it."" ""What will do then?"" I inquired, looking at my watch, 6:32. ""Orange juice will do just fine. The toy firetruck on the floor tells me that you must have that."" I nodded and poured him a glass of orange juice, sitting down across from him afterwards. A few moments of awkward silence followed where he simply sat, sipping at the orange juice almost ponderously. ""Introductions are always the hardest..."" he began, ""I'm what you call a debt collector. Except I only collect for very special debts. The kind someone very arrogant, stupid, or desperate would make."" Half insulted, half intrigued, I ventured: ""Which one am I?"" He laughed with a sort of painful, morbid and hollow chuckle. ""I would say desperate. Ten years ago, faced with death before your time you offered your firstborn in exchange for extra time added onto your own. I guess you didn't realize at the time that these deals do exist, and you were chosen as a recipient."" Infuriated, I squeezed my end of the table, and demanded ""And just who are you to feed me these lies in my own home?!"" The man sighed sadly, extended his arm and touched me, right after I slapped his hand. Immediately, long buried memories returned. ""You were to die in a car accident as written here, in my book of death. You were driving home from a party and you were hit by a drunk driver. The only reason you lived to sign out of the hospital was because you signed over your firstborn son to Satan, my boss."" In painful memory, I recalled it all, and I looked to the small red firetruck that lay on its side in between us on the table. ""Isn't there some other way?!"" I cried, taking the firetruck on the table. ""He's my son..."" The demon frowned sadly, softly removing the red firetruck from my hand. ""I say this all the time.... no. I am sorry. Lead me to him, otherwise the rules state I must take your soul, and those of your other family members as well."" Full of remorse and flagging hope, I lead the man to your crib. When we arrived, the water became a torrent of sobs that wanted to vanquish the fire of the hell ahead of you. I hugged your sleeping body, holding you close. One last time, I begged: ""Isn't there another way?"" ""The only way..."" he started, I cut him off immediately ""I'll do it. Whatever it takes for my little boy."" The demon now drew tears. ""The only way.... is soul for soul. You, as the recipient of the deal, must trade your own soul in exchange for your son's."" My eyes sank to the ground, my heart knowing the only decision that could be made. The demon too, let his eyes fall, and he handed me the firetruck. slowly, I placed you in your bed next to your beloved toy, and kissed you goodbye. The demon mumbled in sorrow. ""Anything you need to do before I write you into the book of death?"" I nodded, and retrieved a pen, my best envelope, and some paper. Frantically, sorrowfully, and sadly, I ran the pen across the letter..... 'Dear John,' it read.",0

"Summary: Parents beam with pride, can't stop from smiling from outpouring of support. Mom: ""I was so happy I didn't know what to do"" Burn center in U.S. has offered to provide treatment for reconstructive surgeries. Dad says, ""Anything for Youssif"" Article: Dressed in a Superman shirt, 5-year-old Youssif held his sister's hand Friday, seemingly unaware that millions of people across the world have been touched by his story. Nearby, his parents talked about the new future and hope they have for their boy -- and the potential for recovery from his severe burns. Youssif holds his sister's hand Friday. He's wearing a facial mask often used to help burn victims. It's the best birthday present the Iraqi family could ever have imagined for their boy: Youssif turns 6 next Friday. ""I was so happy I didn't know what to do with myself,"" his mother, Zainab, told CNN, a broad smile across her face. ""I didn't think the reaction would be this big."" His father said he was on the roof of his house when CNN called him with the news about the outpouring of support for his son. ""We just want to thank everyone who has come forward,"" he said. ""We knew there was kindness out there."" Like his wife, he couldn't stop smiling. He talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in Baghdad, leaving ""no stone unturned"" on a mission to help his boy. There were many trips to the Ministry of Health. He says he even put in a request to Iraq's parliament for help. The family eventually told CNN their story -- that Youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on January 15, doused in gasoline and set on fire. Simply by coming forward, his parents put themselves in incredible danger. No one has been arrested or held accountable in Youssif's case. Watch CNN's Arwa Damon describe 'truly phenomenal' outpouring ». Shortly after Youssif's story aired Wednesday, the Children's Burn Foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in Sherman Oaks, California, that provides support for burn victims locally, nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for Youssif and his family to come to the United States and to set up a fund for donations. You can make a donation at the foundation's site by clicking here. There's a drop-down menu under the ""general donation"" area that is marked ""Youssif's fund."" The foundation says it will cover all medical costs -- from surgeries for Youssif to housing costs to any social rehabilitation that might be needed for him. Surgeries will be performed by Dr. Peter Grossman, a plastic surgeon with the affiliated Grossman Burn Center who is donating his services for Youssif's cause. Officials are still trying to get the appropriate visas for the family's travels. ""We are prepared to have them come here, set them up in a housing situation, provide support for them and begin treatment,"" said Barbara Friedman, executive director of the Children's Burn Foundation. ""We expect that the treatment will be from between six months to a year with many surgeries."" She added, ""He will be getting the absolute best care that's available."" Youssif's parents said they know it's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in America may not be easy. But none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost. ""I will do anything for Youssif,"" his father said, pulling his son closer to him. ""Our child is everything."" His mother tried to coax Youssif to talk to us on this day. But he didn't want to; his mother says he's shy outside of their home. The biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave, and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in Iraq. But this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that January day -- has new hope in the world. That is partly due to the tens of thousands of CNN.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act. CNN Iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border. In a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world, it was a refreshing realization. CNN.com senior producer Wayne Drash contributed to this report in Atlanta.",0
"Summary: San Diego mayor declares state of emergency; White House, governor offer aid. Officials were investigating the shifting earth in the area for weeks. Residents can return to 75 of the 111 evacuated homes Thursday, mayor says. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking,"" says one evacuated resident. Article: More than 100 homes in an upscale San Diego community were evacuated after a landslide about 60 yards wide pulled the earth from beneath a three-lane road and some of the multimillion-dollar homes that adorn it. Gina Yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in Wednesday's landslide. Mayor Jerry Sanders declared a state of emergency, asking California and the federal government to help the La Jolla community recover from the Wednesday landslide. As of Thursday morning, he had already received offers of aid from legislators, the governor's office and the White House, he said. Officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along Soledad Mountain Road. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. On Wednesday, a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes. Holli Weld told San Diego's KGTV that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed. Watch a resident recall how he had to grab his dogs and run ». ""The street was sinking before our eyes,"" she said. Authorities told KGTV that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred. Evacuated homeowner Russell Moore told CNN he remembers hearing the earth ""groan"" in what he called a ""slow avalanche."" ""The asphalt that should be under my feet was 8 feet in the air,"" Moore said. ""We watched the trees snapping and cracking and more boulders come down to our feet and we were witnessing this move."" See photos of the hole the landslide left in La Jolla ». At least 111 homes were evacuated, but Sanders said residents would be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. Several homes were damaged and at least one was destroyed, according to media reports. Nine homes are ""red tagged,"" meaning no one is allowed to enter them, and 27 more are ""yellow tagged,"" which means residents can return for necessities, but cannot stay, Sanders said. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the landslide downed power lines and caused a minor gas leak. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday, KGTV reported. The Red Cross opened a shelter at La Jolla High School. Deputy city engineer Robert Hawk told the Union-Tribune that the hillside has slowly been slipping for years because the soil is unstable. Landslide incidents in the neighborhood date back to the 1960s, Hawk told the newspaper. Pat Abbott, a retired geological sciences professor at San Diego State University, told the Union-Tribune that Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature. ""Gravity pulling on the incline is pulling down masses of earth and those masses of earth have houses on top of them,"" Abbott told the paper. ""It's a geologically bad site and should not have been built on to begin with.""",0

"Prompt: Some time in the future war is fought completely autonomously by machines. A densely populated city has become a war-zone, but the robots are programmed so well to avoid harming civilians that the humans living their can go about their lives completely ignoring the constant fighting around them Story: At first, I didn't even notice the Battle of New York City. I figured the endless drones hanging in the sky were a result of the new president's initiative on homeland surveillance; however, it turns out they came from enemy soil. Like insects, flying robots swarmed in the sky, carefully dismantling factories and buildings so not harm anyone. When our guardians came, their camouflaged exterior and American flag patched along their limbs told us they came to our indifferent rescue. Sparks and bullets flew through the air like fireworks, but that wasn't an excuse to miss work. Dressing in a suit and tie, I went through my daily commute, letting drones and robots exchange bullets and punches as I went to the subway, where I found a temporary solace from their petty fighting. When I emerged from under the earth, the battle raged on. A street vendor needed to put his umbrella over his cart, because while the robots caught most the large debris from the fighting, the odd nut or bolt would fall in the food. A few homeless men scoured for scrap metal of the fallen soldiers and would occasionally cause a scrap, which elicited more of a response from the city dwellers. When the police ended the calamity from the bums, the sidewalks filled again with busy men and women like nothing happened. When I walked into the office building, the news confirmed that peace talks between the US and China ended. Obviously not surprised, I found myself at my desk to find, at my dismay, one of the robots had taken my window. I called maintenance, who quickly rectified the situation. As I waited, I watched the robots dance in the sky. I read somewhere that generals thought the nature of war shifted from killing to pure financials and production in a country. I remember the school system making a similar remark about how World War II began the shift, with the Allies being able to out-produce the Axis Powers, winning the war, though with great bloodshed. How barbaric were those times that wars were fought with men and guns. The battle continued in the night as I carried on with ignoring more helicopters and planes fixed in the sky. I could never see the stars in the city, so their presence never truly bothered me. The latest news broadcasts informed us that the president was weighing his options in declaring war on another nation while asking the citizens to stay focused and refuse to let the war interrupt their work. I moaned about inconvenient another war might be. I suppose I must live with the robots blocking out the sun and stealing my windows for a few more months. ***** More stories at r/Andrew__Wells",0
"Prompt: Tinder becomes a giant corporation and essentially a government institution worldwide. Everyone gets an obligatory implant that automatically notifies matches you come across or walk by. Story: *Bing* The interface places a green outline around a tall woman with chocolate skin and bright red lipstick. I smile at her, pretending that I am ignoring the stats that scroll to the left of her wonderfully frizzy hair. We are compatible, at least in the eyes of the programming from our Tinder chip implants which, to be fair, was usually pretty accurate. It managed to gather data about your personality, health, and socio-economic status in addition to information provided by an interests and life goals quiz which requires yearly updating as long as one remains single. She looks back and makes no effort to hide her judgement when she comes upon my family history. The green outline becomes red and she walks away. Rejection is just that simple now. No contact needed. You enter a bar and immediately know who is worth your time and who isn't. Which is bad news for people like me. *Bing* Another green outline. It changes red and she walks away, pace hastening as if I were planning to chase after her or something. You aren't that remarkable, sweet cheeks. *Bing* I turn off the damned sound and don't even bother looking at her information. As a person who doesn't go out often, I forget how annoying that noise can get. It changes red and I sigh, strolling into the bakery and stepping into the line. I can smell the heat of the oven despite the overwhelming scent of bread. It's subtle but I like it a lot. My chip senses the stimulation and adds something into my profile. Great, I guess if I meet another lover of delicious scents I can frighten her off as well. Much to my disdain, a green line forms around the young woman at the counter. She should have put her interface into work mode, it would prevent awkward encounters like this. It stays green as I approach, pretending I haven't noticed while gazing over the menu. “ What can I get for you? ” Her voice, soft but still upbeat, captures my attention and I make eye contact with her. Blue eyes, my favorite. Not that I'd turn someone away for anything different. I've just always been a sucker for big blue eyes. The line is still green and she is smiling. Maybe she hasn't read yet. “ Oh, just a tomato and mozzarella panini, please, ” I reply as I pretend to look for my wallet, hand squirming around foolishly in my pocket. “ I have a lunch break in a few minutes, could I join you? ” “ Really? ” My eyes are narrowed, brows pulled down in a combination of confusion and suspicion. “ Yeah, we have so much in common. Plus, we are both reading Martian. The movie was great but I am loving the book. We could talk about it or something, ” she shrugs, rosey cheeks still round and tensed from her warm smile. She has to have read it. My current book is listed far below that damning piece of information. “ Oh, that would be great, ” I reply, trying to relax as I place my card on the counter. Once I pay and take a seat, waiting for my food, I realize that I've not yet read her stats. My gaze returns and I activate the list, allowing it to be pulled away from her figure and into the center of my table. A line of red text appears under the “ health ” heading. Cancer? She has cancer. She doesn't want kids, which is good for me, and we have a remarkable amount of similar interests. Even our travel bucket list is nearly identical. Maybe the cancer wasn't that bad. “ By the look on your face I assume you read, ” she hums, placing my plate down and sliding to the seat across from me. “ Yes. Did you read, I mean -- Most people don't really like what they see. My father and all. ” “ I did see that. But, having a madman for a father hardly says anything about you. ” “ You realize he killed seven people. He ate them. ” “ Shh, don't ruin your lunch. So, what chapter are you on? ” We talk for an hour about books and life and death, goals and what we want to make of ourselves. After her break ends we exchange information and I go home, smiling as my interface registers my planned date and ceases to advertize me to those who pass by. We fall in love on the second date. It wasn't anything more than a small dinner in my less than dazzling apartment, but she was amazing. We were amazing. Her cancer is terminal. After years of treatment she was given five to ten years and wanted someone to spend it with. Someone who makes her feel alive. Apparently I make her feel alive. We date for a few months before she asks me to marry her. She tells me that I am like the much needed bookend on her half-full book shelf. Even though she'd never have a full collection, I was there to told her up -- fill the empty space. I know that I will lose her in the end, but, for once in my life I feel free of judgement. I feel like I have escaped the thing that has kept me pegged as “ unsuitable ” for the majority of my life. I am just me, living with her. Until the bitter end.",0

"Summary: ""I thought I was going to die,"" driver says. Man says pickup truck was folded in half; he just has cut on face. Driver: ""I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall"" Minnesota bridge collapsed during rush hour Wednesday. Article: Drivers who were on the Minneapolis bridge when it collapsed told harrowing tales of survival. ""The whole bridge from one side of the Mississippi to the other just completely gave way, fell all the way down,"" survivor Gary Babineau told CNN. ""I probably had a 30-, 35-foot free fall. And there's cars in the water, there's cars on fire. The whole bridge is down."" He said his back was injured but he determined he could move around. ""I realized there was a school bus right next to me, and me and a couple of other guys went over and started lifting the kids off the bridge. They were yelling, screaming, bleeding. I think there were some broken bones."" Watch a driver describe his narrow escape ». At home when he heard about the disaster, Dr. John Hink, an emergency room physician, jumped into his car and rushed to the scene in 15 minutes. He arrived at the south side of the bridge, stood on the riverbank and saw dozens of people lying dazed on an expansive deck. They were in the middle of the Mississippi River, which was churning fast, and he had no way of getting to them. He went to the north side, where there was easier access to people. Ambulances were also having a hard time driving down to the river to get closer to the scene. Working feverishly, volunteers, EMTs and other officials managed to get 55 people into ambulances in less than two hours. Occasionally, a pickup truck with a medic inside would drive to get an injured person and bring him back up even ground, Hink told CNN. The rescue effort was controlled and organized, he said; the opposite of the lightning-quick collapse. ""I could see the whole bridge as it was going down, as it was falling,"" Babineau said. ""It just gave a rumble real quick, and it all just gave way, and it just fell completely, all the way to the ground. And there was dust everywhere and it was just like everyone has been saying: It was just like out of the movies."" Babineau said the rear of his pickup truck was dangling over the edge of a broken-off section of the bridge. He said several vehicles slid past him into the water. ""I stayed in my car for one or two seconds. I saw a couple cars fall,"" he said. ""So I stayed in my car until the cars quit falling for a second, then I got out real quick, ran in front of my truck -- because behind my truck was just a hole -- and I helped a woman off of the bridge with me. ""I just wanted off the bridge, and then I ran over to the school bus. I started grabbing kids and handing them down. It was just complete chaos."" He said most of the children were crying or screaming. He and other rescuers set them on the ground and told them to run to the river bank, but a few needed to be carried because of their injuries. See rescuers clamber over rubble ». Babineau said he had no rescue training. ""I just knew what I had to do at the moment."" Melissa Hughes, 32, of Minneapolis, told The Associated Press that she was driving home when the western edge of the bridge collapsed under her. ""You know that free-fall feeling? I felt that twice,"" Hughes said. A pickup landed on top of her car, but she was not hurt. ""I had no idea there was a vehicle on my car,"" she told AP. ""It's really very surreal."" Babineau told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune: ""On the way down, I thought I was dead. I literally thought I was dead. ""My truck was completely face down, pointed toward the ground, and my truck got ripped in half. It was folded in half, and I can't believe I'm alive."" See and hear eyewitness accounts ». Bernie Toivonen told CNN's ""American Morning"" that his vehicle was on a part of the bridge that ended up tilted at a 45-degree angle. ""I knew the deck was going down, there was no question about it, and I thought I was going to die,"" he said. After the bridge settled and his car remained upright, ""I just put in park, turned the key off and said, 'Oh, I'm alive,' "" he said.",0
"Summary: Survivors of Cyclone Sidr in Bangladesh waiting for aid to arrive. Red Crescent Society official says deaths could rise to 5,000-10,000. Bangladeshi president distributes aid; angry survivors go empty-handed. Thousands remain missing; estimated 280,000 homeless. Article: Survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of Bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones Monday as they waited for aid to arrive. Villagers grieve in Patargata, around 125 miles south of Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, Monday. The number of dead killed from Cyclone Sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the South Asian nation continues to assess the damage. The Bangladesh Red Crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000. In the fishing village of Galachipa, in Patuakhali district, Dhalan Mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities. ""Nothing is going to happen. That was our first thought and we went to bed. Just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons. Our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper, and we all ran for shelter,"" Mridha, a 45-year-old farm worker, told The Associated Press. On the way to a shelter, Mridha lost contact with his wife, mother and two children. The next morning he found their bodies. The Category 4 cyclone raked Bangladesh's southwest coast on Thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h (150 mph), destroying fishermen's hamlets and villages. Thousands are still missing, while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm. Many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them. Most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron, and had no chance of withstanding the storm's powerful winds. In addition, the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as Sidr pushed through, wiping out many villages and littering the river's shores with debris. Watch as people are left to fend for themselves ». Low-lying Bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country. Improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991, when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands. Bangladesh President Iajuddin Ahmed visited the devastated region Sunday, handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media. It was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious. Security officials struggled to hold back the crowd. See dramatic photos of storm survivors ». Sidr has already ruined Bangladesh's rice harvest, but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past. Nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country's rice production in 1974. International aid organizations promised initial packages of $25 million during a meeting with Bangladesh agencies Monday, the U.N.'s World Food Program said. The United States has offered more than $2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief, and sent two U.S. Navy carriers to help in recovery operations. In addition, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person Department of Defense medical team is in Bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm. Bangladesh's government held an emergency Cabinet meeting Saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues, Bangladeshi government spokesman Fahim Munaim told CNN. Officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions cannot yet be determined. Munaim said nearly a third of Bangladesh's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone, most of those along the southern coast. The Bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced. International aid groups -- including Save the Children, World Vision, and the Red Crescent, which already have offices in Bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions. Roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm, or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use. Clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process. Along the broken road that leads into Kolapara, the body of an 8-year-old girl called Rummie was carefully carried away for burial. Overwhelmed with sadness, her mother Khadija was steadied by a relative. ""I am feeling too much pain in my heart,"" she said. ""I have lost my daughter, so I am a victim of the cyclone as well.""

Answer: The results of these analyses suggest that marginally higher rates of depression to age 35 amongst the comorbid MD/AUD group were explained by increased exposure to adverse childhood circumstances amongst members of the comorbid group. Adolescent MD/AUD comorbidity is likely to be a risk marker, rather than a causal factor in subsequent MD.",0
"Summary: Condoleezza Rice responds to foreign service officers' objections on Iraq duty. ""Directed assignments"" will be enforced if enough officers don't volunteer in Iraq. Rice: Department doing ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats"" One official calls order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"" Article: State Department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn Iraq, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice says that ""people need to serve where they are needed."" Rice was responding to foreign service officers' objections to the possibility of ""directed assignments"" in Iraq. The issue has caused an uproar in the State Department, resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting Wednesday. The new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers don't step forward to fill open positions at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. If the State Department enforces directed assignments, it will be the first time since the Vietnam War era. One official called the order to serve in Iraq ""a potential death sentence"" during the town meeting. The State Department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates. Those chosen will be given 10 days to respond, according to last week's announcement. Unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse, those who decline could face dismissal, it said. Wednesday's heated meeting was replayed on an internal State Department television channel in Washington several times and talked about widely. Some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly, learning about it instead from news organizations last week. Watch the diplomats exchange angry words ». ""I just have no respect for the whole process because you've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues,"" said foreign service officer Jack Croddy. ""Thank you for that comment. It's full of inaccuracies, but that's OK,"" Harry Thomas Jr., director general of the foreign service, shot back. Others pointed out the risks of such assignments, considering the dangers of a war zone, lack of security and regular rocket attacks on U.S. personnel. Rice, who did not attend the meeting, tried to calm things down Friday by underscoring the State Department's attempts to do ""everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats."" However, she said, ""This is one of the highest priority tasks of the United States, and we're going to meet our obligations."" Speaking to reporters en route to Turkey and the Mideast, she said, ""I don't know if we will have direct assignments or not, but we are one foreign service, and people need to serve where they are needed."" The secretary sent out a cable to State Department employees worldwide encouraging them to serve in Iraq. ""This year [U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker] has identified the need for additional positions to more effectively accomplish our mission in Iraq,"" Rice said in the cable. Rice said she has decided to go forward with the identification of officers to serve, ""should it prove necessary to direct assignments."" ""Should others step forward, as some already have, we will fill these new jobs as we have before -- with volunteers. However, regardless of how the jobs may be filled, they must be filled,"" she said. Rice earlier said reports that the State Department was finding it hard to coax foreign service employees into Iraq ""couldn't be further from the truth."" The assignments are new positions. Fifteen people have stepped forward to volunteer for Iraq service since the new policy was announced October 26, department spokesman Sean McCormack said. McCormack rejected comments by Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-California, that State Department employees are ""nervous Nellies"" and that wounded U.S. military veterans should be asked to fill the Iraq vacancies. McCormack said until now the State Department has been successful in filling jobs in Iraq with volunteers. Since 2003, more than 1,500 personnel have volunteered to go to Iraq, he said. But with the expansion of the staff in Iraq this year, 58 spots were left open. ""They are serving in dangerous and challenging places,"" he said. ""We have a lot of brave people who are stepping up to the plate in Anbar and Basra and Baghdad and Kabul and a lot of other places that are not necessarily in the headlines."" State Department employees have been killed in Iraq, but McCormack could not say how many. CNN's Zain Verjee and Charley Keyes contributed to this report.",0
"Prompt: You pray to God, wishing that you will get a boyfriend/girlfriend before you die. He gives you immortality. Story: I went to church the first time last week. My grandma had tugged my arm and dragged me into her car with a promise of a ""restaurant breakfast,"" and before I knew it, in my morning grogginess I was greeted with pews and angry hushes. I had shot her an angry look, at which she swatted my hand. I never liked church. I never prayed. But maybe it was the environment, no, who am I kidding, it was my Grandma's powerful presence, or maybe the fact that I accidentally spilled coffee into my crush's locker, another no-go to join the other past 30 crushes, that made me bow down. And then, I wished something that I would regret. ""God, before I die could I just have one girlfriend? One?"" ""And that's when you stopped being able to die?"" Dr. Martinez said flatly, shooting me an incredulous look. I look up at her from my hospital cot. ""Well I've shot myself, I've electricuted myself, I've hanged myself, I gave myself carbon monoxide poisoning, and I overdosed."" ""I see, so you have been trying for a while."" ""Well I did those in my garage last Tuesday night actually."" ""Ah."" She's not bad. Long blond hair with grey eyes that flashed in the light. Assertive too. ""So how do you want me to help you?"" ""Go on a date with me?"" ""Is that your approach?"" she said, her expression unchanged. ""Uh - I think you're pretty?"" ""That's it?"" ""I happen to make good omlettes, so I'd probably be a good quality -"" ""I think I'm going to stop you there."" I frowned. ""Ok."" ""Maybe you need to meet someone at your level. Because obviously you don't know what you are doing with that approach."" She sat straighter in her chair. ""I have another patient with the same ""relationship"" issue, and while she's been learning techniques to improve her relationships, she is still needing someone to interact with. Perhaps you two could go practice, and go on some dates?"" ""Is she pretty?"" ""And, we'll stop there.""",0

"Prompt: Killing another human now allows you to exchange your remaining lifespan the victim 's. Young people live in fear while the elderly plan their attacks. Story: ""Happy birthday dear Gertrude, happy birthday to you!"" The chorus rang out, prompting a ruckus of claps and cheers from the crowd of onlookers. We were gathered around an immense circular table, at least twenty feet across by my best guess. Atop this table sat a cake, a cake altogether too large to be allowed. It was hard to look at, not because of the size, but because of the thousands upon thousands of candles it supported. The tiny flame of each candle melded together in my eyes to create an inferno of magnificence only worthy of my favorite grandmother's birthday. ""Well blow them out then, and make a wish!"" Someone shouted, getting a collective laugh from the room. ""I'm going to need a little help"" My grandmother said with a wide smile. Everyone inched in a little closer and began blowing the candles out, ten or twenty at a time, until the last one was extinguished by my grandmother herself. ""What did you wish for?"" uncle Elmer asked. ""You know I can't tell!"" replied Grandma. A few moments later, after the excitement settled, we moved on to presents. She received the things you come to expect after so many birthdays; jewelry, delicious foods, tickets to an upcoming symphony and the like. She was grateful for it all, but none so much as the last gift she opened. My grandfather had slipped out of the room during the commotion, and reappeared pushing a large decorated box on four wheels. ""Darling, what have you gotten me this year?"" My grandmother asked, shooting him a skeptical look. ""Oh this? It's just something I picked up last minute"" He replied, with a sly smile. My grandmother got up from her chair and moved as best she could over to the box. She lifted the lid just a few inches and peered inside. A toothy grin spread across her wrinkled face and she flipped the lid off and reached inside. Out she pulled an infant child, no older than a few weeks, and shouted ""babies!"". The room erupted with a cheer and everyone came closer to catch a glimpse. ""Gary, you shouldn't have!"" Shouted Grandmother. ""How could you afford so many?"" Uncle Elmer asked. ""Just had to move some things around is all"" Grandpa said with a wink. Just then, grandmother spoke up, gaining the attention of the room. ""Everybody get's one, I won't hog these all to myself, isn't proper!"" Excitedly, My Grandfather began passing infants around the room. Finally, when everyone had their hands on one, then I said ""Alright grandma, you first! It's your birthday after all!"". The room grew quiet as she lifted the baby above her head with both hands. She looked around the room at all of us, drinking in the moment, and then spiked the baby to ground. She had sparked something in all of us with her intensity, and everyone began spiking their babies to the ground, one by one, with thuds and splatters and sequels. Just a moment later and the violence was over. Everyone laughed and hugged and joked, and everyone felt a little younger.",0
"Prompt:You 're moments late to literally everything. You watch busses pull away as you run behind them, girls get asked out as you walk up to them, and you have never caught a green light. One day though, you arrive on time. Story: For as long as I can remember I've been late for everything. My mother even used to joke that I was born a week late. So I guess I started things off on the wrong foot. Every morning I was late for school. Every night I was late to bed. It was something that everyone in my life grew accustomed to. I *tried* to be on time or early but nothing ever worked out that way. Traffic was always bad, I could never take the bus because I could never catch it. Or I had a flat tire. Sometimes I even got into accidents. My insurance wasn't cheap either because of all of this. But despite everything I managed to live a somewhat decent life. I had a decent job, a decent family, a decent house. The car.... not so much due to all the accidents. After the first 30 years of being habitually late I gave up trying to be on time. Life worked out. Life went on. People got annoyed but forgave me. Thankfully my boss was a lenient man. At 70 I finally retired. A bit late to that as well, but I got to enjoy my golden years with my lovely wife and grand children. Despite being related to me, no one in my family seemed to catch my curse. The kids were always punctual, probably because they saw how late their old man was for their entire life. Laying on my bed surrounded by my family, I reflected on my life. Despite being late it was good. I smiled and closed my eyes ready to finally die. I was probably late to that as well. As my final breath left my body, so did my soul. I was lifted out of bed to see everyone around me crying. I waited.... and I waited.... for HOURS I waited. I watched my body being hauled off by the mortician. I watched my family hug each other and cry. And I continued waiting. What was supposed to happen next? Was I supposed to do something? Was this what the end was? I started to question my sanity. I started to question if it was a dream. Three days later, as I was standing in the living room watching my grandchildren play and my children plan my funeral a man appeared. He was well dressed in a nice suit. He had a very forgettable face, not ugly, but not attractive. He looked down at his pocket watch that was attached to his lapel. It had a small Scythe insignia on it. ""I'm sorry I'm late"" He said. ""We didn't think you would be on time. Why don't you come with me and I'll bring you home?""",0

"Prompt: Gay marriages have just been legalized nationwide. Whether or not you agree, you find yourself involved with one. What is the experience like? Story: I hear the angry protesters outside. I can see them from this window. Holding up signs that display all matters of vulgarities. The hatred and wrath, etched on their faces, it makes me sick to my stomach. I wish I could say something to change their mind, but they wouldn't understand me. Don't get me wrong, I'm great at speeches actually. I just don't think they'll listen. Too disgusted by the hatred, I turn and look away. I see both the grooms, looking lovingly into each other's eyes. How is this any different than anyoother wedding? I've seen many weddings and each one had couples like these. Love sick and spewing sappy words to each other. I like listening and watching as they pronounce their love to each other. It made my heart a flutter, thinking I'd find a mate. I watch as they are pronounced as marry and kiss. I look at the others in the crowd, all with different expressions. Jealousy, hatred, love, happiness, they are all there. I don't feel phased by any of it. I wait as the cheers die down. When it's calm and silent, I feel a sudden urge to sing. I inhale and start to lavish their hearing with a song. I put my whole heart I to it. Each note clear and concise. The crowd looked at me in awe. I continued, for I never sang in front of so many people. It only made me continue with fervor. I finally let the last note ring out, and watch as the crowd start clapping and cheering.Embarrassed at all of the cheers, I find the nearest exit. I stretch my wings out and fly through the window.",0

We're close on their heels anyway, the skirmish today proved it. We don't *need* the information."" Thind patrolled slowly around the dim glow of the campfire, three dirty, cowled faces looking up at him. Laeg pulled the pipe from his mouth as a thick trail of smoke wafted above his head. ""I wouldn't mind killing him-this is a war, after all-but make it quick. I'll do it myself if it makes a difference."" Glan shook his head. ""Like a bound pig for slaughter? Like an animal?"" Laeg puffed on his pipe, and glowered behind its dusky embers. ""We're given it the benefit of the doubt that it isn't one, I say. We can't risk letting it go in any case."" ""A single orc grunt is a serious threat to our security?"" ""A single orc killed Coll, and Rhosg, Maidh."" Thind looked down on the ranger darkly. ""It only takes one. In any case, he's seen our camp, our numbers, our condition. Even if we re-positioned, the risk is too great. He we don't leave him, and we don't let him go."" Glan returned the look. ""So we are discussing his execution? With the possible added incentive of torture?"" Elu shook his head across the fire. ""I do agree that that particular aspect isn't necessary. We'll be on the war band by tomorrow afternoon, there's no need to string him up for an interrogation."" ""Since they're patrol didn't return, they'll be ready for something, someone. Extra vigilant. Killing him without getting something from him is a wasted advantage we can't afford."" ""What you should be asking is can we afford to take this advantage?"" Glan said softly.

But if we sink to their level.... then isn't their hate a just recompense?"" ""A strike returned in kind, force for force, is justice, not indulgence."" Glan shook his head. ""You're wrong. Anything more than necessary force *is* indulgence. We defend ourselves. We do not ruin. We do not mutilate."" There was silence around the fire. Then Laeg stood. ""If you do it, I don't want to know about it. And that's all I have to say."" He turned and walked off into the deepening dusk. ""That's the cowards way, Laeg."" Glan called at his back. Laeg didn't respond, and soon faded between the trees with practiced ease. Thind turned to Elu. ""What do you think?"" Elu stared at the glowing coals of their small fire. ""I think.... I would like to feel good about defending my home. That shouldn't be tainted with shame."" ""I'm sure Naru would say the same."" Glan quickly chimed. Thind glared at him. ""I'm less sure of that, personally. I think Naru would agree with his captain and acquiesce to command perogotive without a debate. But it doesn't matter. I'll withhold final judgement till the morning. Elu will relieve Naru from prisoner watch in three hours time. Glan, you'll take over after him.

He squealed as he was wanked from his place on the forest floor and suspended above it like a butchered pig. He twisted around until he was faced with one of his captors, the small, ruddy ranger with empty eyes. He casually gripped a small, skinning knife in his right hand. ``'Ello, love."" Targhed said brightly. ""Come to give your regards? I have to say the other boys were a sight more accommodating than this."" ""They'd have me accommodate you further."" Thind replied evenly. ""I want to know what you know. But there's only one way for me to do that. And they're a bit squeamish at the idea."" Targhed pulled his lips back to reveal grey, decaying teeth, and black gums. ""Ye rangers usually are. All that nobility don't mean a pigs bladder when it comes to the dirty work of fightin'."" Thind gave a thin smile. ""No. Not always. You see, they would hold that, if I were to interrogate you.... torture you.... hurt you, that I'd be no better than you."" Targhed shrugged. ""Makes sense to me, far as I can see."" Thind shook his head. ""But it doesn't. Because you're different. You aren't a person, or even an animal when it comes right down to it. You, are war. You, are hate. You are a thing, a feeling, a personification. And the question is not if we'll become like you, but how much we will become like you. How much will you, oh war, taint us?"" Targhed shook his head. ""Fancy words, and purple talk. You don't got it in ye though. You ain't bred for it like we are. You're bred to write them fancy words, drink sweet drinks and-"" His words were cut off by a lightening fast strike that sent him swinging on the tree branch. Targhed spat black blood on the ground, and watched the ranger spin in his vision. ""That ain't gon na convince me you got what it takes."" Thind nodded. ""I know."" **** Yards away, Glan stirred under his blanket, the harsh screech of a bird waking him from a light sleep. He raised his head from the ground in time to see Laeg walking off into the trees, away from their camp. The sound came again, and Glan paled. It was no bird.",0
"Prompt: A king is blessed with triplets. Rather than choose one as his heir, he separates the trio and sends each to a secluded island with a small retinue, to see which will grow up to be the most deserving of the throne. Story: As I opened my eyes I could see the sun rising on the horizon out my window. But that wasn't important, I had another one of my ""dreams"" last night. I'm not sure what else to call them though as they often signal things to come. My earliest memory is of the dream I had when I was only 4 years old. Before my men had built this fort. It was the catalyst that made me grow up, and build the fort in the first place. I'd had a dream that Sir Lucas, my senior advisors oldest son, the one that had come here with him when I was a baby was killed by one of the beast-men. And the next day we found his body clawed to pieces. After we'd buried him my first order was to clear an area in the center of the island and to start building the walls. It was a bloody task with many of my own men dying, but we'd got it done, and we now had a defensible position, and my ""dreams"" had been more pleasant. I'd predicted safe births of children, and I'd predicted attacks by the beast-men which allowed us to repel them with ease. But this dream was different. I saw at least a hundred poorly built boats each seating 3-4 warriors landing on our shore. I didn't see whether they were friendly or not, but I must warn everyone. If they're not friendly then we stand no chance. Our fortifications may be able to keep out the beast-men, but trained warriors would have the knowledge and tactics that the beast-men lacked. But there is still hope. The soldiers bore a crest similar to my own. My families crest was was a silver knight emblazoned on a blue background. There's was the same knight, but black rather than silver, and on a red background. Just then I heard a sharp rap on my door and realized I'd been laying in bed worrying for far too long. My ""dreams"" always came true exactly 1 month after I first saw them. But for now I must get up, the knock on my door was Sir Duncan, my senior advisor telling me that the meeting of senior officials was starting soon. So I got up and put on my clothes, the ones Sir Duncans wife Mary had made for me for my last birthday. It was my favorite outfit, it was very comfortable while still maintaining the royal appearance I was expected to maintain. I couldn't stop thinking about my ""dream"" as I made my way to our meeting room though. Something kept knawing at me though and I knew that I had to address it in todays meeting. It couldn't wait. ""Good morning your highness"" Sir Duncan was the first to greet me as usual. He was a battle hardened man, his face and body weathered from years of battle, and a scar on the right side of his face reaching from his eyebrow down to his jaw, and is salt and pepper hair. But despite his hardened appearance and booming voice he was still the kindest man I knew. ""Good morning Duncan. But how many times must I tell you? When we are in private you should just call me James."" ""Yes your high- sorry, James."" *sigh*"" You'll get it one of these days Duncan"" ""If we can move passed these pleasantries sire we have much to discuss"" It was Quimby that spoke next. He wasn't a warrior like most of the men father sent with me, but he was an integral part to our survival thus far. He was the brains behind the operation. The slender man with the long hooked knows like the beak of a hawk may not know how to swing a sword, but without him the place would have fallen long ago. He was the one that tracked our food and water, and our rates of consumption and always made sure we were stocked well enough to last through any siege the beast-men could mount. ""Yes Quimby, we absolutely do. What news do you have today?"" ""We're running slightly low on meat. We could survive another month, possibly 2 if we ration with the current harvest, but we both know these men need their meat"" ""Ah yes, we shall send out hunting parties today then"" I replied. This would be the first party we sent out since the death. It seems the Beast-men are done trying to attack us head on and are attacking our hunting parties instead. ""Make sure they are well guarded though. I want at least 2 guards with every hunter, and I want every group to be carrying a horn. If they're attacked I want to know about it before we find the bodies."" ""Yes sire"" Quimby seemed proud that I was learning to be such an efficient ruler. He had trained me well for nearing 2 decades now, and it showed. ""Does anyone else have any news?"" I asked those assembled, my spy master Dennet. Another advisor my father had sent with me he was a small wiry man that wore a strange cloak that helped him blend in, and always carried his longbow with a quiver full of arrows, and a short sword. He was slightly younger than Duncan, but they had served in many battles together and trusted each other with their lives. ""We saw another boat passing on the horizon today, but nothing of consequence, and the beast-men seem to be quiet for now."" His words about the beast-men were reassuring as I was sending men out to hunt today, but the news of the ship worried him. ""Were you able to see the banner the ship was flying?"" I knew it was a long shot, but I had to ask. ""No sire. It was too far off."" ""Well. If that's all you have to report then I must tell you now I had another of my dreams."" I told them about the dream in vivid detail as I always did. I could tell by the look on Duncan, and Dennets face that it was bad news. ""Did you say 100 men? Wearing a crest of black knight set in a red background?"" Duncans voice was trembling slightly. I didn't think I'd ever see the day where Duncan was scared but he certainly seemed that way now, and I could see even in the hooded cloak meant to hide his face Dennet was nervous too. ""Yes. But they didn't attack, I woke up before I could see what happened next."" ""They will attack. And they will be looking to exterminate us all. They will kill our men and children and rape our women. That sigil is the house of the O'Carricks, your father most vicious enemies. If Henry O'Carrick is coming here it is not for Tea my lord. And if they're coming with 100 men we can not take them on our own. We only have 20 men of fighting age."" Dennet was deadly calm, but something in his voice belied his facade and I could tell he was shaken. ""But our men are elite soldiers, and we have a defensible position with-"" ""Our men may be great fighters my lord but even the greatest of men would fall before 5 average soldiers. And the O'Carricks have been taking fortresses much stronger than this one for years."" Duncan was right. We couldn't fight them, even if I didn't want to admit it. But I couldn't let my men die because of my pride. ""What do you propose?"" I asked looking from one adviser to the next. To everybodies surprise Quimby was the first to speak. ""What of the Beast-men?"" he asked nervously? ""What about them?"" I was confused. The beast men were a problem, but hardly the issue right now. ""Well, we know they can speak, and they speak our language as we've seen from the few prisoners we've had, perhaps we can release the one we've got now with a message that we want to meet in a neutral place to discuss a truce. After all the if the O'Carricks attack they will exterminate every living creature on the island. It is their way."" I was shocked. As was everyone at the table. ""The beast-men?! How could we ever work with them?! Have you forgotten the countless lives lost building this fortress? Or the countless lives they've lost trying to take it? They are savages through and through!"" Duncan was the first to respond, but Dennet looked unsure. ""What do you have to say Dennet?"" I asked curiously. To tell the truth I was nervous. Quimby could be right, and it could be our only option. But Duncan was right, there had been a lot of bloodshed on both sides, and neither side was likely to trust the other. ""They may be simple but they're not savages"" Dennet was speaking slowly, choosing his words carefully ""but.... I don't think they can be trusted."" ""If they knew the situation and the O'Carricks reputation would they fight them?"" A plan was forming in my mind. I know my men won't fight with the beast-men. But I've got a loose plan. ""Yes, I believe so. But I can not be sure they would honor a meeting in the first place. Nor can I be sure that our representative we send to the meeting would make it out alive."" ""I've got an idea. Samuel, send word to the guards we are to release the prisoner with a message. I want their leader to meet with me on the northern coast of the island. We may each bring 2 guards but no more."" Samuel was one of our younger soldiers. He'd been born days after we arrived on the island and because he was one of the only people on the island my age we had become close friends. ""I cant believe you're actually considering this. The men would never fight alongside those *beasts*"" Duncan spat the last word out like just saying it left a bitter taste in his mouth. ""I have a plan for that. On the day of the attack we will meet the O'Carricks on the beaches. As soon as they land we will charge out of the trees and attack. The element of surprise will help us. But once they start to form up we will retreat back towards the treeline. When we start to retreat we will send the beast-men in to attack them from both sides and we will attack them from the front again. If all goes to plan the beast men can attack completely separated from us, and since they will have the clearly safer role they will be more likely to agree."" I knew my plan wasn't perfect, and we would take casualties. But there's no other way. We don't have the numbers to flank the enemy from both sides, and we don't have the numbers to win the battle on our own. We needed help. And it seemed all 3 of my advisers knew it.",0
"Summary: Nationwide Airlines pilot dumped fuel until he landed plane Wednesday. An object was sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground. 100, including crew, were on the plane; no one was injured. Plane passenger: ""Everyone started panicking"" Article: Brendon Pelser said he saw pure terror in the faces of his fellow passengers after an engine fell from a wing as it took off from Cape Town, South Africa, Wednesday. Men were sweating profusely, women were crying. ""There was fear on their faces,"" Pelser said. ""Everyone started panicking."" But the pilot of Nationwide Airlines' Boeing 737 Flight CE723 was able to fly long enough to dump fuel and make an emergency landing at Cape Town International Airport. Including crew, 100 hundred people were on the plane that departed at 3:50 p.m. on an hourlong flight to Johannesburg, South Africa. No one was injured. The jet had only been in the air about 10 minutes before the engine fell. ""We heard something crash and bang, the plane veering left and right. A person on the right side said the engine was missing -- had broken clean off,"" said Pelser. Watch Pelser describe how the flight crew told passengers to ""prepare for the worst"" ». ""They flew us in very slowly. We were all prepared for the worst. We went into the fetal position, head between the legs,"" he said. ""Then we hit the runway."" ""I did kind of pray. I didn't want to die. I'm not really ready to die,"" the 33-year-old said. An object had been sucked into the engine as the nose wheel lifted from the ground and officials are trying to identify it. The engine-to-wing supporting structure is designed to release an engine ""when extreme forces are applied,"" to prevent structural damage to the wing, Nationwide said on its Web site. The airline described the incident as a ""catastrophic engine failure."" As the nose wheel lifted from the ground, ""the captain heard a loud noise immediately followed by a yaw of the aircraft (sideways slippage) to the right,"" the airline said in a news release. The flight instruments showed the No. 2 engine on the right side had failed, it said. Pelser said he spent the night in Cape Town, then flew back to Johannesburg where he lives, on the same airline. Nationwide said the engine had undergone a major overhaul in March 2005 at ""an approved Federal Aviation Authority facility in the U.S.A."" and had flown only 3,806 hours since then. ""These engines typically achieve 10,000 hours between major overhauls,"" Nationwide Airlines' press release stated.",0
"Prompt: Write a story about a doctor living in a world in which the technology exists to physically connect to another person and feel their pain. Story: Jackie… Jackie… The only name that keeps me sane. I repeat it over and over as the emotions flood through me. It is always different, no pain ever is the same. Sure, at first just the pain on the surface is the same, but the deep pain that is tucked away is always different. Every time it is a blackness that washes over me when connect to the patient. I have never gotten used to the pain but I try to get through it by repeating my wife's name. It is difficult but my wife's name and images of my daughter get me through. This patient came in for depression like must of my patients. Unlike most of my patients though she was one of the few children that I have diagnosed. Her name was Maria. I was told she could be suffering from depression but they needed me to make a diagnosis so that she could get treatment. When she walks in I give her a smile. She acknowledges me with a look that children should never have. Just a blank stare devoid of any of the innocent joy that most children have. I greet her mother and we exchange pleasantries and I direct Maria to take a seat. All the equipment was already set up for her so as soon as she took a seat I asked her if she was ready to begin. She nodded. I walked over and took a seat next to Maria and reached for rod that will connect me to her. As I grabbed hold of the rod to connect to Maria I think to myself, *she is only twelve, it can't be… OH GOD!! * The pain was immediate. It hit me like a wall. Images of an older man holding a knife flashed before my eyes. My whole body ached. There was blood everywhere. My mind started to spiral into the blackness. I started to gag, I couldn't breathe. I am begging him to stop but he can't hear me. The knife comes down swiftly. The pain is too intense to bear. I fade into the blackness as I hear a scream. The scream continues as I open my eyes. I see my daughter covered in blood in a heap on the ground in front of me and then I look up to see my wife standing in the doorway screaming. *What have I done? * I plunge the knife into my chest. For once, the blackness is comforting.",0
"Prompt: Write a murder from the perspective of a cheerful inanimate object Story: Not a murder but I tried In my younger years I lived a life of extravagance, I was regularly out at sea, wind and salty water splashing at me, I have to admit that when the salt dried it used to get between all my crooks and crannies and itch a bit but being out at sea was wonderful, such freedom and glee at being taken out by the man that found me in the a little shop. I'm so grateful for that. I stopped getting used as much after a while, I remember a woman doing lots of strange things with the man on the boat that I was on, she came on it occasionally and then I stopped getting used hardly at all. My next point of use was for a very small person, I don't know where they came from but the man cut me in half and attached me to a plank of wood, god that was painful, I always wonder whether my other half is like a worm and is now It's own. Anyway, I got used for this purpose for a while, I can't say I enjoyed it much, I never got put away and I eventually started to ache and begin to break at the bottom. I felt ancient and eventually my bottom half broke away, letting the small person fall to the ground. Little sod, serves him right for treating me this way. I was then retired to a dark place where there was a big metal machine that made lots of noise that the man and woman got into, I spent a while here, it didn't bother me after the existence I'd lived with that small person. It was quiet, dark and all my tired joints weren't being stretched further causing me more pain. My one concern was that I'd never get used again. Alas, that day came. The woman came and retrieved me from my space, I was brought into their house and down some steps into the basement, there was another man there... I'd never seen him before, he was all bare skinned apart from a rubber thing in his mouth, I was attached to him and a chair. I couldn't think what my purpose was, why would she want to tie this strange man to a chair with me? There were lots of strange noises and afterwards she hit him with me aswell. I didn't particularly like this. I was again, put back to my original place and several times I was again used for this purpose. How strange, I wander where the first man that used me was. And here ends my story. The first man, my favourite man came to retrieve me, he tied me from a wooden beam on the ceiling and put a knot a the bottom, ahhh, I love being tied in a good knot, feel like I'm back to good use again, he put his head through it and jumped off a chair. What on earth was he doing? He struggled for a bit before hanging still. The woman came in a while after and she did lots of screaming, a little like the strange man I'd been attached to. Strange, it's normally the one tied up that does that I thought? There were lots of flashing lights and then I was put in a bag and I haven't moved from this place since, I don't really like it much, It's quite warm and I don't see anything interesting anymore. I wish I was back at sea.",0
"Prompt: No human has to ever work again, instead you have a robot that goes to work and earns your pay for you, but you are responsible for keeping it in a good condition. One day you find your robot making a robot to do its work. Story: Rosie broke her left thumb servo again, which means she'll miss another day of work while I try to navigate the phone book for a good replacement. If I wanted to Google it, I'd have to wait until Tom, my next-door neighbor, is home so that his work-bot can run a search query. I don't know why we all thought that our robots should be the only ones to use the internet, but c'est la vie, and all that shit. The phone system's down, of course, so I pocket the broken servo and head down the stairwell to the parts store in the basement of my apartment mall. I pass a couple junkies snorting dust in broad lamplight. They're both blocking the stairwell and the girl's mostly nude, so I have to push the man out of the way and apologize as I do it. He's too numb to notice, which means he hasn't come down yet. Thirteen stories down and the line forms for the next three stories. Everyone's in line to get their pieces. Sarah from 715 is next in line and she smiles at me. ""What's wrong with Harry?"" I ask. ""He ran out of oil,"" she said. ""I told him to get some on the way home, but he's having trouble remembering my orders. I think he needs a new hard drive."" ""Where is he now?"" I asked. ""He's working,"" she said. ""He can still do data entry, doesn't have to remember for too long."" I laugh. I always liked seeing Sarah. She always knew how to make me laugh.",0

"Prompt: In a world where lying is immediately detected by a phone app, you go into a bar and tell your friends you 've had the worst day in the history of mankind. The app detects you 're telling the truth. You proceed to tell them about your day ... Story: I open the pub door. Smells of beer, pub food, and warm bodies hit me. I step over the threshold. I become aware of the petite woman with too-dark makeup laughing. She's leaning on the chest of a man who could grace the cover of a muscle-mag. I force myself to look past them. This couple's holding hands, frilly drinks forgotten. The brunette with the long hair brings the hand of the short-haired woman to her lips, kisses each finger while staring into the other woman's eyes. On my left, a man with broad shoulders and well-defined muscles wheels his chair towards a table, grinning as he greets the attractive redhead waiting there. She blows him a kiss and puts down her phone. I wind my way through the tables, looking for Heidi's tumble of blond curls. There, with Chace by her side. I must have really freaked her out. She waves at me as I pass the last few blissfully unaware patrons. “ Heidi said you claimed you had the worst day ever, and that our app didn't work. ” Chace's head tilts forward and his eyes are almost black. The last time I saw that look, it was right before he threw my ex-boyfriend out the door. I'd been right to call Chace and Heidi over that night. The ex had broken in, threatened to kill me. And after the last few weeks, Chace's hostility is understandable. “ Hi Chace. ” I swallow. “ I understand your … response. ” I pull out a chair, sit down. I shiver in my coat. I meet his eyes, see them narrow. “ You're ghost white, Laurel. This has gotten to the point of crazy. I'm seriously considering calling the mental health crisis line. ” Heidi slides her delicate hand onto his forearm. I fold my hands on the table in front of me. Strong hands. That's what Heidi's mother had said. I shudder and grimace, clinch my hands into fists. I force out “ I'm not surprised. I've considered calling them myself. ” As Heidi leans over the table, I realize I'd whispered. Heidi wraps my fists in her hands. I flinch. She's in mother-mode. “ Have the dreams gotten worse? Last month, it was Pompeii. And then last week, the first world war. ” She moves next to me, wraps her arm around me. I hunch away from her. “ You- you don't want to be close to me. ” Heidi puts one hand on my shoulder, keeps the other on my hands. “ Nonsense. You'll talk about your day, whatever this worst day in your life is, and we'll have some drinks. We'll move past it same way we did when Chace tossed The Creep out. ” The truth alarm from her phone silences the conversations throughout the pub. Chace fumbles with her phone to clear it. I close my eyes. “ We won't ever forget this, Heidi. ” I look at her. The confusion and shock distort her normally peaceful face. I've always been troubled, and her face typically calms me. I'd never see that calm again. “ I dreamt of Hitler, the peace of the early 21st century. ” I finally break. I cover my face with my horrible, strong hands. I smear my eyeliner as I try to regain my composure. I desperately look from Heidi to Chace. He meets my eyes, holds my gaze. I know he'll figure it out. I force myself to look at Heidi. “ Heidi, I'm sorry. I… ” I take a deep breath. “ I saw your great-grandparents. And then your parents. That's when -- that's when I started to figure it out. ” “ No, no. You never met them. ” Tears stream down her face as the horror of her parent's death floods back. “ You never met them! ” She stands as she yells, knocking over her chair. The pub goes quiet again. I manage to whisper, “ I saw their pictures in your house. I… I've seen other things. Heidi, I saw Napoleon killed. I saw the Moradabad riots, the Rwandan genocide… ” I helplessly look at Chace. He holds Heidi's phone, ready to quiet the alarm. His voice helps ground me. “ Today you realized you're seeing the pain of humanity. Every time you sleep. ” I nod. The alarm never sounds. I force myself to form the words, to verbalize the fear. “ What happens after I see today? ”",0
"Prompt: You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. Story: So I was working with the saw and I was tired and slipped and before I knew it, I had a huge gash on my forearm where blood wasn't pouring out. When the initial shock had worn off and the lack of any mind-numbing pain had convinced me that something was *off* about this, I started looking at the wound and that's when I saw it. Wires, shiny copper wires everywhere. There wasn't any more blood, apparently in deep cuts like this there wasn't enough blood to properly bleed. So I tried to clean it out myself which was really hard since touching those wires felt good. I had to resist the urge to pull some of them out. I bandaged my arm and then took some painkillers and went to sleep. The day after I woke up, once I remembered my new situation, I opened up the gauss pad to see if it had gotten better, but instead, it had gotten much much worse. The skin around the wound had started to melt as if it was no longer alive, the smell was horrendous, so I called my good friend Kyle, the doctor, and asked him if I could have a private appointment. From the sound of my voice, Kyle obviously knew something was up, so he told me to swing by his clinic at ten pm. Once I arrived, I told him to grab a seat and told the truth. It wasn't until I showed him the arm that he said ""Geeze, I thought you were having a psychotic episode or something, but this.... this is real isn't it?"" Then after examining the wound, he confirmed that which I already knew, that the skin around it was dying and that it was spreading fast. He then told me he'd need a sample of those wires to know what they were. As he looked at me, I felt a surge of strange thoughts start to course through my head, but I simply nooded and he got to work on getting one of those out. As he started pulling, I tensed up and he tried to ease up on the procedure. After it was done, he apologized for being so blunt and that he didn't know they were that sensitive. I could again only nod at his words. But he'd been wrong about the pain, what I had felt when he pulled it out was a pure and unbrideled sense of exctasy. It was absolute bliss to have it pulled. So while he went over the microscope, I was trying to hide my sudden erection under my coat. It had literarly been one of the most fundamentally rewarding and satisfying feeelings and sensations I'd ever felt in my whole life. But I was interrupted in my thoughts by a strange gurgling sound. When I looked up to where Kyle was standing, I could see that he was bleeding from a hole in his neck, as I watched him he slumped over on the floor and a big blood puddle started forming under his body. Then I saw the wire come crawling out of his body and I knew that it had killed him to protect itself. Now I'm sitting here in a corner in the building, waiting for the police to show up, I've told them everything and even if they don't believe me, they still have to come here and investigate. The wound is spreading more and more over my body, but I don't care about that anymore because of the feeling the new exposed wiring is giving me, it's like the air is singing to it. As more and more of it vanishes, I start feeling more alive, more in tune with my new self a self that only wants to pick... pull... pick and pull... Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire Pull the wire OooooooOOOOoooh... here we..nnggg.... go again......",0
"Summary: Thousands of teens attend Christian rallies each year. Many of the rallies attempt to offer an alternative to secular popular culture. Opponents say these impose conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Article: At one point in Jared Hutchins' young life, the Beatles were a big problem. The rallies, which draw mostly teens, are one part concert, one part Christian revival. ""I had to stop listening to them for a while,"" said Hutchins, who lives in Cumming, Georgia, and plays the piano, guitar and harmonica. He said the group's world view ""had a negative effect on me,"" and made him irritable and angry. ""God owns my life, not the Beatles,"" he said simply. Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to, for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles. Hutchins, a 16-year-old graced with poise and thoughtfulness, is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture, with its ubiquitous references to sex, drugs and violence, has harmed him. Last year, Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta, Georgia, he said. Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania. Go behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a BattleCry event ». One part concert, one part Christian revival, the rallies seek to ""stage a reverse revolution"" against secular popular culture. They have the pull of headlining rock concerts, drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country, the month of year or the day of the week. The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults. From 2006 to 2007, a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies, and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco, California; Detroit, Michigan; and Bristow, Virginia, according to Teen Mania. Watch flags, fireworks and teens at rally. For Hutchins, who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago, the organization's message is exactly right. ""We don't have to be branded by the culture, we are branded by God,"" he said. ""Be who God created you to be."" But the glossy, glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God, Teen Mania followers say. And so, Ron Luce, the 46-year-old founder of the organization, has waged a modern-day crusade against ""purveyors of popular culture,"" whom he has condemned as ""the enemy."" More than two decades old, Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message ""of living completely for Christ."" The organization is sprawling. In addition to its live stadium rallies, there are BattleCry shirts and hats, mobile screen savers, books and a television program. There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana, Mexico, this summer. There is even a Teen Mania internship, a one-year program called the Honor Academy, based in Lindale, Texas. In the live events, Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher's ability to mobilize a crowd. He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel. Today's teenagers are in crisis, he says. ""We're fighting for those who don't know they have a voice, that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that, really, they're not mature enough to be thinking about yet,"" Luce told CNN. ""Kids are hurting,"" he said. And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds, Luce said, ""We call them terrorists, virtue terrorists, that are destroying our kids."" ""They're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk, and everybody's walking by and acting like everything's OK. And it's just not OK."" To some, Luce's rhetoric is off-putting, hateful and divisive. Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not ""in God's plan"" -- and abortion -- the ""ending of a precious life"" -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers. Explore Americans' views on religion. It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head-on in March at BattleCry San Francisco. There, in arguably the most liberal city in the United States, protesters, armed with megaphones and poster board signs, rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own. ""Ron Luce is a liar!"" one protester shouted. ""Let me hear you say Christian fascist,"" another yelled. Luce and the youths, some as young as 11, also raised their voices. ""God, I ask that as we do this BattleCry, Lord, that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers, God, here, God,"" Mindy Peterson, shouted. Peterson is a member of Teen Mania's Honor Academy. Afterward, Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters' mischaracterization of BattleCry. ""These people think that our war is against other people. They think that our war is against man. And our war isn't. Our war's against ... the pain in teenagers' hearts, like depression, alcoholism. Those things that -- that are, like, tearing our teenagers apart,"" she said. While much milder in his terms, Hutchins agrees. ""We're a generation that is kind of troubled,"" he said. Luce wants to ""rescue the hearts of our generation,"" he added. And of the critics' contention that the rallies, the organization, the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse? Hutchins smiles, nods patiently. ""I don't go because I have a political agenda,"" he said, adding that his friends don't, either. ""Mostly, what we're concerned with is Jesus.""

"Prompt: In a post apocalyptic world, a group of humans follow the wise words of The Mighty Magic Eight Ball Story: KLATTA, KLATTA, KLATTA! Thus was our decree. I watched as our leader, Mervyn, placed the scuffed, black orb of truth - lovingly called MMate, into it's hand-crafted leather carrying pouch. Merv, with his dainty soul-patch of red, and a barren face beside (he couldn't grow much more, to his chagrin) peered toward our group of seven. ""Fellows,"" he called above the harsh winds of the frozen Ancient Jersey Highlands, ""long have we wandered, taking heed of MMate, our savoir. Our guide."" With bated breath we watched, Mervyn's comb-over wafting about his dry, flaking scalp. ""Today is the day long awaited. Today,"" he said with pride,"" we have found our homeland which MMate has given unto us!"" ""Merv,"" called Quinten, our cartographer, from the back, ""according to my calculations, we're in an area that was once known as Knee-Wark."" There was a nervous shift in our small crowd. Murmurs of dissent! ""Fear not, my friends!"" Said Mervyn, ""MMate would not lead us astray. We are destined to make our lives here in this place."" ""Yeah, but isn't this where the ancients began their war?"" Asked Blandie, our chef. ""That's correct,"" said Quinten scowling at Mervyn, ""this is where the atomics were first used. Where the land itself was said to spit fire at any who would dare to set foot on it's lands."" There was silence but for the wind. ""Lem me see MMate, Mervyn,"" said Quentin, moving forward with his arms outstretched. Mervyn cupped the leather parcel to his breast and said, ""No!"" before dashing off down the hill upon which we stood, watching, mouths agape. Quentin watched, wary of the scorched land below. We watched Mervyn as he hopped over a small glowing brook and held MMate aloft, shaking the orb as he so often did when consulting our savior. He paused. He shook it again. A scream of rage echoed from below, like a beast woken from slumber to a den filled not with food for winter, but something that's not particularly useful, like someone had replaced the beast's food with twigs and old newspapers. Mervyn dashed off again, holding MMate above his head. BOOM. A pillar of purple flame engulfed our leader, engulfed our savoir. Mervyn's charred form slumped to the ground with a light whump and a cloud of debris. MMate was soaring through the air, back toward us from the force of the explosion. Quentin caught it and peered into the coveted window. The orbs plastics had melted leaving a final message for our frightened band. It read: ""Outlook not so good.""",0

"Summary: UK intel chief says children as young as 15 involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans: At least 2,000 people in Britain who pose threat to security. MI5 chief said the actual number could be double that. Article: The head of Britain's intelligence services has warned that children as young as 15 are becoming involved in terrorist-related activity. Jonathan Evans, the chief of MI5, also said that at least 2,000 people in Britain pose a threat to the country's security because of their support for al Qaeda-inspired terrorism. ""As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country. They are radicalising, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism,"" he told a gathering of newspaper editors in Manchester. Evans said the figure of 2,000 -- an increase of 400 since November 2006 -- only included those the intelligence services knew about and that the actual number could be double. He said there had been 200 terrorist convictions in Britain since the September 11 attacks. The MI5 head added that over recent years much of the command and inspiration for attack planning in the UK had come from al Qaeda's remaining core leadership in the tribal areas of Pakistan. However, he said in the last 12 months terrorist plots on British soil were increasingly inspired by al Qaeda cadres in other countries, including in Iraq and East Africa. ""There is no doubt now that al Qaeda in Iraq aspires to promote terrorist attacks outside Iraq. There is no doubt that there is training activity and terrorist planning in East Africa -- particularly in Somalia -- which is focused on the UK,"" he told the Society of Editors meeting. According to Evans, there had been ""no decrease"" in the number of Russian covert intelligence officers operating in Britain since the end of the Cold War. He said that resources that could be devoted to counter-terrorism were instead being used to protect Britain against spying by Russia, China and others. ""A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,"" he said.",0
"Prompt: At the age of 18, everyone picks an unlikely life event. They will be reborn at 18 every time they die until that event happens. After that, death is permanent. Story: Death by fulfillment. Our society believes that everyone deserves a chance to pursue their ambitions to the finish line. There are those who create masterpieces by accumulating lifetimes of knowledge. Others wish to simply find happiness by experiencing true love, as perfect matches are rare but not impossible given an eternity. But I am afraid of death. Many of my peers still live alongside their parents, as it is likely that both parent and child will not reach their goals in one lifetime. But by some astronomical chance, both my parents have passed. My father, in a stroke of brilliance, painted the picture that now hangs in the National Gallery in the capital. I have not seen it. My mother, being the shy person she is, simply wished to have a child with a man she loved. She had lived fewer lifetimes than father. However she had me and died when I was 8. Simply put, my existence alone had killed her. I am very afraid of death. I still remember that night my mother had been crying. She came home drunk, cursing the fate that she had chosen. She had no one to blame but herself. And me. She might have not meant it. She was drunk. But she wanted to live on. She was afraid of death. My mother's death caused my father to seclude himself from society, embellishing the canvas with feelings that had taken centuries to build but was released when my mother died in a car crash. His masterpiece was one of grief and fear. The height of his career at the lowest point of his life. Within the same day that his work was hanging in the museum, he was hanging from the rope connected to the ceiling. His final artistic rendition. I still have not seen the painting. I guess was only natural that I wished to only die when I was not afraid of death. My peers are long dead now. I live alongside the next generation. Or the generation after that. I lost track of time. Love, school, parenthood, adventure. Nothing had quelled my fear of death. Perhaps it is finally time to learn from one who sought death. Perhaps it is time to take a trip to the museum.",0
"Summary: Jury shown new footage of Diana taken hours before her death. Diana and Dodi Fayed inquest jury to hear ""scene setting"" evidence. On Tuesday coroner outlined controversial claims, published new images. Court will make final decision on what happened in car crash 10 years ago. Article: Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate ""one way or the other"" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear ""intimate"" details of her personal life. Watch footage of Diana's last hours ». Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear ""scene setting"" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family ""could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,"" referring to Diana's son Prince William. ""I'm hoping for justice,"" Al Fayed said outside court. ""At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family."" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. ""You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,"" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. ""The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died."" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash.",0
"Summary: Santiago Fire deliberately started in two places, official says. Santiago Fire grows to 25,000 acres. L.A. authorities investigate man arrested for suspected arson. Blaze has destroyed 22 structures. Article: One of the larger fires in Southern California was deliberately started by someone with apparent knowledge of arson, a fire official said Thursday. Firefighter Luke Perisin sets a backfire Wednesday against the Santiago Fire in Live Oak Canyon, California. The Santiago Fire in Orange County was started in two places along a little-traveled road, according to Chief Chip Prather of the county's fire authority. The fire, which has burned more than 25,000 acres, was started in brush just off Santiago Canyon Road, not close to homes. It spread rapidly, indicating the arsonist had some knowledge of winds and other factors. ""It is a confirmed arson. There was evidence found at the scene. That is the purpose of our early declaration of it being an arson-caused fire,"" Prather said. He would not describe the evidence. Watch how the evidence points to arson ». Prather said officials originally thought the fire had three points of origin instead of two. The Santiago Fire's points of origin are considered crime scenes, said Jim Amornino, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. The reward for information leading to an arrest has increased to $250,000 -- $50,000 each from the governor's office, the U.S. agency of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the FBI, Prather said. KFI radio has chipped in another $100,000, the sheriff's department said. The state established a toll-free arson tip line at 800-540-7085. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said anyone convicted of arson would be dealt with harshly. If a suspect is to be found, ""it's going to be by a clue from the public,"" said county Sheriff Mike Corona. About 1,100 firefighters were working on controlling the Santiago Fire, which has destroyed at least 22 structures, according to Orange County Fire Battalion Chief Kris Concepcion. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said the fire was only 30 percent contained Thursday morning after being 50 percent contained the day before. Watch the Santiago flames rage ». The motive of the Santiago Fire's arsonist was a mystery to Concepcion. ""That's the part that I really can't figure out, to tell you the truth,"" he told CNN. ""That individual knew on Sunday when this fire started that we had, really, the perfect storm, if you will. We had the heavy Santa Ana winds, we had the low relative humidities, we had the high temperatures. ""And then for someone to even think about doing something as reprehensible as starting a fire where they knew the fire would grow as rapidly as it would -- traveling about three, 3½ miles in about an hour -- is just really absolutely unconscionable,"" he said. The smaller Rosa Fire in Riverside County, 100 percent contained at 411 acres Thursday morning, was also probably arson, state officials said. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Fire Department investigators are looking into whether a man who was arrested on suspicion of arson in the San Fernando Valley may have had a role in any of the ongoing blazes, an L.A. police spokeswoman said. Catalino Pineda, 41, was arrested Wednesday, Officer Kate Lopez told CNN. Witnesses told police they saw him lighting a fire on a hillside in the West Hills area of San Fernando -- northwest of Los Angeles -- then walking away, Lopez said. Pineda was already on probation for ""making excessive false emergency reports"" to police at the time of the arrest, Lopez said. His bail has been set at $75,000, she said. The fire he allegedly set was brought under control, but now authorities want to find out if he had any role in the other wildfires. In San Bernardino County, John Alfred Rund, 48, was arrested Tuesday evening and charged with setting a small fire along a rural roadside near Victorville. Rund was to be arraigned Thursday morning in Victorville. He was being held in lieu of $750,000 bail. The county's district attorney's office on Thursday also filed arson charges against Anthony Riperti, 47, of Redlands. A statement from the office did not say when or where Riperti is accused of setting a fire. He is being held on $250,000 bail and will be arraigned later Thursday. The San Diego County Sheriff's Department also arrested an adult and a juvenile accused by an anonymous tipster of starting a fire in Vista in the northern part of the county. In a written statement, the sheriff's department identified the adult as Gorgonio Nava. The Vista Fire Department extinguished the blaze before it grew out of control, the statement said. Investigators have determined that the Grass Valley Fire in San Bernardino County was not caused by arson, and a preliminary investigation into the cause of the 10,152-acre Slide Fire seems to indicate arson was not a factor, sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beaver said.",0
"Summary: Kelly Pless started gaining as a teen and weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. Exercise and an ""eat to live"" eating philosophy helped her shed 95 pounds. Pless started out walking but now runs 40 miles a week. She is training to run two marathons this winter. Article: If someone had asked Kelly Pless to describe herself three years ago, the word ""fit"" would have never crossed her mind. Kelly Pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest. She lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise. For most of her adult life, the 31-year-old graduate student from Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, has struggled with her weight. She started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school, she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5' 2"" frame. Prom, she says, was a nightmare. ""I had to go to three different stores to buy a dress,"" Pless said. ""I had to buy the biggest, also the ugliest, prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit."" After high school, she lost 50 pounds. But because she hadn't done it in a healthy way, her weight crept back up to 220 pounds. At 28, she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame. She reached her breaking point. ""I remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just wasn't something I could be,"" said Pless. ""I remember feeling like even if I tried, it wasn't something my body was capable of."" Despite her doubts, Pless decided to do something. Fortunately she didn't have to look far for inspiration. See before and after weight loss photos from CNN.com I-Reporters ». ""My manager at the Kennedy Space Center ran marathons, and he was the same age as my father,"" she said. Because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health, he seemed much older, she said. Over the next three to four months, she began walking, without any real goal or expectation. Pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more, everything would fall into place. ""At first, it was hard to start exercising because I was worried people would make fun of me,"" Pless said. ""But then I just told myself, if that's the worst that could happen ... I just got out there and didn't care."" Eventually, she started to run or ""shuffle"" as she jokingly recalls. She also adopted an ""eat to live"" philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit. ""I changed how I felt about food and what it meant to me,"" said Pless, who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate. ""One of the first things I cut out was cakes and cookies. That was my weak spot. After a few months of cutting those things out, I focused more on portion control,"" said Pless. ""I pretty much eat when I'm hungry and don't eat when I'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are. Make sure I'm not eating out of boredom or [at] social events, I try to make sure I'm not overeating, just because everyone else is."" Kelly Pless shares her weight loss secrets ». Pless pays close attention to societal pressure, which she believes is the reason many people overeat. Restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size, she says. She makes sure she doesn't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there. ""What's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that aren't necessarily good for you, or actually change how you look at food. That was the hardest part for me."" Instead of giving in to the temptation or convenience of calorie-laden or fatty foods such as cheeseburgers from the drive-through, Pless asks herself, ""What do I really want to eat? Or, what does my body really want right now?"" All of the hard work and determination paid off. Pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1½ years. As a result, she says, she's healthier and more confident. She's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders. ""[The] negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently. Being fat was a good filter -- I'm automatically treated better by people because I'm thinner. Society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese,"" said Pless. ""Now, those people think I'm funnier or smarter."" Pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter. The first is in November in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the second is in Miami, Florida, in January. Forty pounds ago, the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin. But now, she said she can't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require. ""Running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight, which is now about 125 pounds,"" said Pless. If her past is any indication of her future success, Pless will certainly cross the finish line. I-Report: Have you lost weight? Share your story, tips and photos",0
"Question: Aromatase inhibitor-related musculoskeletal symptoms: is preventing osteoporosis the key to eliminating these symptoms?

"Prompt: Every aspiring superhero must become a sidekick for a few years before being granted full time hero status. You are the strongest superhero in your age group, but believe you have been assigned to the weakest hero. You learn a lot more than you originally thought you would. Story: Tar. They assigned me to Tar. I take down Hansel, The Jump, and Guerilla, all together, just to get The Council's attention, and they assign me Tar. They say Mindreader is never wrong, that she assigns the perfect fit for every new sidekick. There's no way. Tar is a mid-table Tier Three on his best day. The Jump, the weakest of the three I took on? High Two, on his worst. Tar is a Tier Five – THE LOWEST TIER – hero, and they assign me to him. I'm a god, and I get him. What can he even do? He turns liquids into tar and back, right? The scientific side of me says that that sounds real powerful – after all, the body is 70 % liquid, or so my teacher says. But his powers don't work like that, else he'd be a Tier Two, maybe Tier One. So here I am, sitting in this empty lobby, waiting for him. What kind of a hero has a lobby anyways? No secret cave, no tower, no other-dimensional world? Just an office building downtown. Tar walks out. He's not even in costume, not that it means anything. He's got a business suit and slacks, and a nice grey tie. The epitome of boring. I stand up, and pretend to look excited to see him. I can see the boredom in his eyes, the emptiness. I have to remind myself that this is a superhero, not some middle aged accountant with nothing in his life. Tar walks over to me, introducing himself as Howard MacDonald. He mentions, as a side point, that he's more known as Tar. As if that isn't the center of a superhero's life. It's just a casual mention, you know, nothing important. This man could theoretically kill dozens of people (on his best day), but he's Howard MacDonald. God. I introduce myself as Zeus. Normally, a superhero will go through nearly half a dozen nicknames before deciding, but I knew what I was calling myself the second I realized the extent of my powers. I was a god. Tar smiles, a weird smile hinting towards something – fatigue, maybe. I remember a friend telling me that supposedly Tar gets a lot of sidekicks. I wonder why, briefly. He starts talking again. ""So, you're my new sidekick, then?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""Is there anything that was left out of your file that you want to let me know now?"" The file stems from a three-part interview. First, they go around to your friends and family, spending a week or so interviewing and interrogating them about me, about them. Then, I'm put through a four hour test and interview. Finally, and most annoyingly, I'm handed over to an anonymous hero, if you could call them that, for a day's worth of torture. Nobody, not even the people in charge, like the concept, but ever since Tenton's defection as soon as he received full access to the information and resources of the Superhero's Guild, they implemented a more rigorous testing system. There's been no breaches since. ""No, nothing comes to mind, sir."" ""Please, call me Howard, or Mr. MacDonald, or Tar, or whatever you so please. None of this formal stuff – I can tell it's offputting to you."" ""Thank you, Tar."" He gave me a half-smile and invited me into the backroom. It wasn't much, though I'll admit the supercomputer was quite a sight. Tar and I both sat down, and I looked around the room, lost for what to do. A hand on my shoulder grabbed my attention, and Tar motioned to the computer. A search engine of unknown origin was opened. It read ""Knowledge"". I vaguely remembered an old superhero that went by that name. The first thing that Tar typed into it was ""Google"". My eye twitched, truly a hero with a supercomputer couldn't have been this technologically illiterate. He opened up the first result in a new tab, and then went back to the main page for the Knowledge search engine. He switched back to the now-open Google tab, and typed in, ""what happened to Connery?"" Enter. Connery was an old superhero who had disappeared. He was wildly popular… for the two weeks he was around. Then, he disappeared. Public opinion was he made some sorta rookie mistake, or perhaps overestimated himself and died due to overheating, freezing, radiation, something like that. The Google results, leading to places like SuperheroNews, BBC, Fox, Reddit, Yahoo Answers, all corroborated those assumptions. Tar switched back to Knowledge. ""what happened to Connery?"" The results immediately popped up, leading to websites I didn't recognize. SuperNet, Karl's Corner, The Library, and other sites that seemed vaguely related to various superheroes, or heroes as a whole. He clicked on the SuperNet one. It was some kind of forum, obviously limited to superheroes. It was a single thread, under the subforum ""Preservation and Records"", with the first post being by Mindreader, on the 24th of April, 2017. About a year ago. ""To those it may concern, Connery is no longer with us. As some of you predicted, his overzealousness got the best of him, and he took it upon himself to storm The Glade's base, all by himself. We were sent the ashes last week, 17/4/2017. He has since been buried, as his overzealousness, once again, meant he left no post-mortem requests. -Mindreader"" I swallowed. ""You're lucky. Normally, I don't tell my sidekicks why they were assigned to me until months later. I was asked by the Council, specifically Mindreader, to just spell it out for you. She didn't say if it was for a good reason or for a bad one. I suppose we'll both find out over the next few years, eh?"" Zeus suddenly didn't sound too awesome of a name.",0
"Prompt: A device has been invented that allows the user to gaze upon Heaven or Hell. Hell is terrifying, and those who see it often need counselling. But their terror pales compared to those who witness God 's domain. Story: The damned didnt scream. It was silent all throughout the hellscape. Eternity has worn on the tortured souls, even writhing was beyond them. They all looked the same, I noted, wearing the cloth of thousands of metallic wires, scraping off the ever further scarring skin with every labored movement. Their path was a mystery to even those who delve into this world for research, for a living. The endless lines stretched across the grey expanse. Color could no longer exist in the presence of such agony. I switched off the room, writing my first experience of hell into my journal before it wrote itself into my psyche. The worst part was that I knew some of those people, this machine took me to people I would recognize. Not by face, but by deeds. I saw my rapist, gaunt face bobbing as he was marching forward, the most profound fear and pain I've ever seen. I saw my grandfather, the man who put me through college, and earned me my best job, and even introduced me to my wife. He suffered the same torture. After weeks, and many warnings from my colleagues, I switched the machine back on, and chose the setting ""heaven"" None of what I was told could prepare me for what I saw. I was taken through the tunnel, or what we perceive as a tunnel, and was deposited into a softly lit room. I was acknowledged by the short, cute brunette sitting at a desk against the center of the wall. She looked up at me with passing interest, and I wondered how she reacted to the first few living visitors. She gestured to a door with patience, and said I was allowed 10 minutes. I found this curious, as many friends of mine spent a much longer time in there, rest their souls. I entered and gasped; it was beautiful. I was told it would be, and that I should take solace in that. I could earn my way there, I was told. We all could. Walked through the forests, and deserts, and the tundra, the beautiful landscapes dotted by happy looking homes of the inhabitants. I was told to never enter them, but I only had three minutes left after exploring for what seemed like hours, and my curiosity had bested me. I chose a quaint bungalow on a private looking beach, and I knocked. I waited for what felt like 20 minutes, though only 1 had passed. Finally, I decided I needed to see, I had to know how I could possibly live in heaven one day. I still had a minute and a half left when I logged out of the machine, vomiting and sobbing. They were dead. The family of 5 was sitting at the table, pre-emaciated, and now rotted. The baby was in his mother's lap, against her stomach, held to the very end of their second lives. I tried to seek out others who would speak of the experience, and found a new friend, someone who walked in on a similar scene, a mother with two daughters, sitting by a fire, though the affects of weather weren't felt in that world, also emaciated, also rotted. It seems that everyone has starved to death. There is little food in heaven. I learned later, that one can die of many things in heaven. Starvation, physical attacks from others, and even accidents. Worst of all, though, is that even if one were able to easily eat in heaven, many people were found to have died of old age. Heaven is an unsustainable eternity, ending for those who earned it, in non-existence. I'm almost glad grandpa went to hell.",0
"Prompt: Most of the Milky Way galaxy is ruled by an interstellar empire, populated by hundreds of alien races. The species of the ruling monarch keeps changing; once they die, the emperor is reborn as a member of one of the many races. You 're the first human-reincarnation of this ruler. Story: The years before ascension are always my favorite, born with all the knowledge of my past incarnations there was really no need for me to ""grow up"" or be educated in the nuances of galactic rule, but long ago I decreed that each of my reincarnations must be allowed to grow to the age of majority before taking the throne. Death has not terrified me for many mellinia, each passing brings new possibilities, and a welcome break from my galactic responsibility for a few years. I do not know the mechanism by which my reincarnation is chosen, many theories abound, some species have been blessed a half dozen times, others never, and on a rare occasion I am reborn to a race yet to join my Empire, these I relish with great gusto, for it means they will play a pivotal role in the future of my Empire. Most are gifted with advanced technologies or cultures with deep and profound philosophies and art. My first day on Earth, January 1st 2016, was very confusing. Born into a primitive backwater, the people were vastly different from what I had come to expect from new entrants to my Empire. They had barely reached into space, their planet was divided into hudreds of squabbling groups and their culture was badly in need of development. In time I discovered why, while primitive, weak and Shor lived, these humans had a thirst for knowledge, a passion for exploration and had developed their technological prowess with amazing speed. They were fighters who found victory against overwhelming odds time and again, created inspiring art, music and stories. I grew up in a place called Florida, learned to enjoy the long hot summers, mild winters and the amazing variety of scantily clad women the white sand beaches attracted year round. 18 years in this primitive paradise and I found myself sad when the Imperial Dreadnought appeared in orbit, eclipsing the moon to announce to my newest subjects their ascension into the galactic Empire. I will miss this pale blue dot, but the Empire can wait no longer.",0
"Prompt: A voice in the sky will tell you when you 've left a place for the last time. You tell your SO goodbye and head out to [ location of your choice ]. Halfway there you hear `` You have visited a location for the last time. '' Story: John wrinkled his nose and cleared his throat. Pausing, he put down his briefcase and adjusted his tie. It was a red tie with white stripes. This was one of his favorite ties. He picked up his briefcase and walked to his car. It was the last car in the lot, as was common on every night for John. A black Ford Taurus, 1998. He walked with his head held high, and his left hand fumbled for his keys in his pocket. There were many things on his mind at the moment, one of which was pulling out those damn keys without his wallet hanging on to them like an unexpected prize from a claw machine. But the larger thought that had taken residency in his mind, was the voice. The voice that told him that he would never step foot in that location again. A small smile cracked at the thought of this, but was quickly hidden with a deep breadth. Now John was never too keen of nature, but this air tasted sweet to him. Something he had never noticed before. Finally, he reached his car. Unlocking the door, he placed his briefcase in the passenger seat. He thought of his daughter and of his wife. He thought of all the hours of work, and how it had finally got him to the point he was today. He replayed in his mind what his boss said to him, You are getting a promotion, no more floor work for you now, now you will manage your own branch of factories. You are your own boss now. As John turned the ignition nothing happened. After five twists, the Taurus sputtered to life. If there was a form of car bronchitis, this car was definitely patient zero. After the drive home, John was ready to unwind in his small apartment with his family. By the end of the month, John would never step foot in that beat down car, or that run down apartment again. He would hear that first, from the voice.",0
"Prompt: Write a terribly sad story, but change it to be beautiful with the last sentence. Story: I first met her when I was 5, at a playground my mother used to take me. I knew right away that I want to be with her for a very very long time. Her glorious halo of golden hair that frames her majestic face made her look like an angel. We went steady at a pretty young age and got married soon after we found out about baby Agnes. But baby Agnes did not join us. She was only 7 months old in her belly when baby Agnes's heart stopped beating. We were very sad, even though our 22-year old faces didn't show it. But we were there for each other, we held each other up so we could be stronger together. The drinking helped too. The first time I was hospitalised after falling down the stairs was after the day I celebrated my 24th birthday. It was entirely my fault, I shouldn't have been shouting so loudly at her, she didn't mean to elbow me when she turned around. I only broke a toe at that time. She looked so beautiful trying to apologize to me, when it's obviously just an accident. We started putting knives away when we had another accident a year later. We were doing one of our silly arguments again when I was being too stubborn to understand what she's trying to say, and in her excitement to show me, she accidentally hit one of the knive's hilt that caused it to fly through the sky and hit me in my eyeball. I started wearing an eye patch after that, and went around calling myself ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" for the kids in the neighbourhood. When she started talking to me about leaving, that's when I realised that I've pushed her away too far already, and I really need to change so I can always be the best for her. I got a new job that made her happier, spent more time at home and tried to do more chores at home. In fact, I was so determined to show her how I've changed, that I stopped drinking soon. I told her that it's all hers to enjoy, since she was always happiest after a good session of drinking. I lost her to a disease soon after that. The doctors said it was too late to do anything for her, with the amount of poison in her. I didn't understand it at all, we tried to eat carefully and always brushed our teeth after every meal. How could she get sick so quickly? ""I said, my name is Adriana. What's yours?"" I snapped back to the playground I'm in, I'm still sitting on the see-saw and she's still standing in front of me with her hand in front of me, waiting for me to shake. ""I'm Jack."" I said proudly. Then I showed her my Tonka truck, and when she squealed happily at that, I knew we were going to be best friends forever.",0

"Prompt: God shows you 3 Doors. Door One leads to eternal happiness, Door Two leads to infinite knowledge. Then there is Door Three, and God has never opened it yet. Story: Three choices lie before me. Eternal happiness, what is Eternal happiness? Is there really a place to never feel down or depressed? I remembered when I was first sitting on the examination table waiting for the big wooden door to open entering the doctor. Time seems at a stalemate as the clock in the room was stuck at noon. Ages fly by before the doctor finally enters the room with a yellow folder in his hand. ""Im sorry to say, but you have cancer."" Is there really a way for me to be back with my beautiful wife who stuck by me till my last bed ridden day? But is it worth has eternal happiness where ignorance is bliss or is it best to have the means to seek the knowledge behind happiness and what makes it eternal? Maybe even the meaning of life and why are born into a forsaken world where there's nothing but disconnects, pain, suffering, disease, depression, sorrow and dispair. The third door is what, a illusion of false hope of something better than the first two doors? Or is the door something we deeply desire. Why has on one before me this door before me? Is it truely a door that God has never opened once? He knows whats behind the door for sure. I bet he wants me to open the door, but you know what? I'm the one who is going to fucking open this door because I sure as hell is the one that wants to open the door not him. The door grow immensely as I approach it. God's eyes grow as he smile draws to a blank. The open opens before me and I am sucked into the darkness. The door closes slowly behind with God watching my eyes slowly turn to darkness. There is no light in this place, only the dark. A woman is screaming and breathing very heavily and I see a dim passage of light in the distance. I have only being drawn to the light and finally escape the darkness. Now in the light I slowly forget who I am and unable to speak or move out of my free will I have wrapped up and placed in warm, soft, loving arms.",0
"Summary: South Africa lead New Zealand by 287 with 8 wickets standing in the 1st test. The Proteas reach 179-2 in their second innings after the Kiwis are 118 all out. South African paceman Dale Steyn takes a career-best 5-34. Article: South African fast bowler Dale Steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the Proteas took a tight grip on the first test against New Zealand in Johannesburg. Steyn's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. New Zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to South Africa's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings. Hashim Amla and Jacques Kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as South Africa stretched their lead to 287. South Africa's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings. They snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the Kiwis could only muster 56 runs. Former New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap Ross Taylor's 15. Fleming was struck on the right forearm by Steyn and did not field during the afternoon. Coach John Bracewell said he had gone for precautionary X-rays but there was only bruising. New Zealand, 41 for two overnight, lost nightwatchman Shane Bond, bowled by a Steyn yorker, before Makhaya Ntini claimed the crucial wicket of Fleming, who was well caught by AB de Villiers diving to his left at third slip. Scott Styris and Taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled. Steyn's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at Centurion two seasons ago. It was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests. Ntini took three for 47 and Kallis two for 11. South Africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers Herschelle Gibbs and captain Graeme Smith out cheaply, but Amla and Kallis blunted the attack and then took charge. They batted together for 205 minutes, Amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while Kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76. The Kiwis were left to regret Brendon McCullum's failure to hold a chance from Amla off Shane Bond, when the batsman had only scored two. ""The ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum. It cost us a lot,"" said coach John Bracewell.",0
"Prompt: There are 6 people on an elevator. It suddenly shuts down and a voice from the speaker said: The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive. Story: He dragged himself out of bed reluctantly. It's been a while since he's had to use this odious alarm clock. Been a while since he's had to rise before noon. He knew he should be happy about getting a job interview after 9 agonizing months of dinking, internet porn and endless online job applications (and really the job applications were the only addition to the routine from his employment days). But he was also acutely aware of the countless, nameless others who were applying, networking, interviewing. Well-qualified, degreed, experienced. He wasn't much of a doer, so to speak. He had gotten his associates degree after a string of unfortunate hourly gigs and that afforded him opportunities a cut above the miserable retail and food industry hell that he knew so well. And that was enough. Until the layoff. After a brisk shower and the blackest cup of coffee, he headed to the apartment parking lot. His banged up car looked even more banged up than usual. Got in, ignored the smell, and headed toward the ugly faceless building that looked very much like the place of his previous employment. The elevator smelled of sweat and cheap cologne. He pressed the button for the third floor. It appeared his elevator mates – all five of them – were all headed for the same floor. Judging by their formal attire, visitor badges and nervous expressions, probably to interview for the same measly position. Of course. Preening her dry, stringy hair, the heavy-set woman in front of him was throwing furtive glances at her the other occupants. And what a miserable bunch they were: A tall, skinny man with a serious face and sallow skin fidgeting with his old-fashioned brief case; some pimply youngster, probably fresh out of college; an older guy in a wrinkled suit and a rat-faced, blondish fellow with an unpleasant smile. That smile quickly disappeared when the elevator shut down with a terrible, violent sound and a robotic voice from the speaker announced: “ The elevator will only function if there is only one left alive. ” He laughed. Was this a joke? The pimple faced started saying something with a whiny, nasal voice. The woman shushed him: “ Quiet! Maybe it's a test? Part of the interview, you know. ” Test or not, Rat Boy looked deranged. His unpleasant smile stretched to its limit, his small yellow teeth showing. “ You bet it is, ” he hissed. And then he lunged forward clawing at the woman, reaching for her throat. Meanwhile, his sallow faced companion got busy jabbing at another with what appeared to be car keys. Thick blood splattered the grimy walls of the elevator. He felt something wet on his face. Probably blood. Piercing screams filled the small space-turned-a-Gladiator-arena. And then an impenetrable darkness cloaked him. When he came to, his eyes slowly focusing on the growing wet spot on his crotch, he realized he had passed out and was now surrounded by blood and the disfigured corpses of his rivals. He was never much of a doer, really.",0

"Prompt: Each morning, every human on Earth must pray their Reasons for not dying that day to the God of Death. If the Reasons are sufficient, that person will go on living, potentially forever. However, you are the longest living human by far, and people now hunt you in order to hear your Reasons. Story: The sun is almost gone again. I ran. I ran as fast as I could. The branches of the dry trees hit hard the face of those who pursued me, for they could not sweep through the forest as I could. It is not the first time I have been here. Hell, It is not the 100th time. I grew up in these woods, no one knows it better. I came down the hill, climbed the hollow tree and here I stay, hearing their screams getting closer and louder. They are angry, I dont blame them. Through the hole in the trunk I can see the man with the axe, stomping the floor with his giant feet and those bloody eyes that scream for themselves. By his side, another man, shorter but just as scary, dragging a piece of wood that would knock me out with only its weight. There are women, children, all kinds of people from different villages and they all yell to know how I do it, what I say, what is the secret. But when I tell them, they do not believe. The questions are now being replaced with orders. Orders to find and kill the witch. I now barely breathe, I can't risk they hearing me. The birds sing as I open my eyes to see the sun rise again. I take a peek through the hole, all I see are the tracks they left. It is time. As I climb out of the tree I hear a little girl's shout: ""There he is!"" and they come out of their hidings, surrounding me with their wicked smile. That is the last thing I see before having my forehead smashed by the wooden club. ""You lasted a whole night this time, not bad."" ""Please, make it stop. At least make my body age again, they think I am a witch!"". ""That would take all the fun out of it. An old man would not be able to do what you just did. The night is young, and so is the danger.""

"Question: Do somatic complaints predict subsequent symptoms of depression? Answer: Our findings suggest that somatic complaints may represent one, but not necessarily the most important, risk factor for the subsequent development of depressive symptoms in women in nonclinical populations. The results also highlight the importance of including social variables in studies on women's depression as well as conducting additional research to further examine predictors of depressive symptoms in men.",0
"Question: Do general practice characteristics influence uptake of an information technology (IT) innovation in primary care? Answer: The analyses show that structural characteristics of a practice are not associated with uptake of a new IT facility, but that its use may be influenced by post-graduate education in the relevant clinical condition. For this diabetes system at least, practice nurse use was critical in spreading uptake beyond initial GP enthusiasts and for sustained and rising use in subsequent years.",0

"Prompt: You are a serial killer. Each murder you commit adds a new voice to your head. Story: “ Oh God, please don't, please don't, ” wailed the voices in my head. I wished they would shut up for a moment. They made it hard to hear if the girl in my trunk was waking up. “ Don't do it you sick bastard. ” There was old man McAvoy, shouting over the rest. I was pretty sure he yelled so loud because he was deaf. After all, he really should have heard me in the alley behind him. It had been a cloudy night and I'd tripped over a rusty trashcan, but that old coot had kept on fumbling with his keys and stopping to rummage around in his pockets like he had all the time in the world, instead of four hours. I pulled into the parking lot of the motel where I was staying and cut the engine. As I approached the trunk of the car, the wailing crescendoed. “ Cut it out, ” I grumbled, rubbing the bridge of my nose, “ Or I'll take it out of her skin. ” About half the voices fell silent. The other half were too crazy to listen or too angry to care, but the volume in my head was manageable at least. “ You sick motherfucker, ” McAvoy railed. “ I can't wait til the cops catch ya. They're gon na beat your sorry ass and stick you in the chair faster than… ” “ Faster than I can kill this girl? ” I muttered, lifting her body out of the trunk. “ Oh yes, that's quite true. I'm going to kill her slow, old man, just for you. ” As I arranged the girl on the double bed by the door, a matronly voice joined the fray. “ It's not too late for you. The Lord can forgive his children any sins. Repent! ” “ That's sweet of you, Mrs. Washington, ” I murmured to my freshman physics professor. “ But I don't feel an ounce of remorse. ” I began laying out my tools. Knives, mostly. I collected knives everywhere I went. My fingers brushed against the wooden handle of an old kitchen knife—my first knife, my first kill. “ You know, Mrs. Washington, ” I said. “ I really have so much to thank you for. Sure, I killed Matilda before I killed you. But that was just one murder—and you don't become a serial killer with just one kill. Especially not when that kill is your ex-girlfriend. ” I shuddered. “ How cliche. ” I surveyed my other tools, and though my eye caught briefly on the screwdriver I'd used on the widower in Portland, I kept coming back to the wood-handled paring knife. On the bed, my newest addition to the series was beginning to wake. “ I'd gut you with your own knives, you fascist pervert. Slam that screwdriver in your eye and that saw up your… ” “ Murderer! Murderer! Aaggggghhhhhhh murder! ” “ Please, James, ” Mrs. Washington said again. “ Your last murder can be your last. You can end this. ” But amongst the chorus of voices, I finally heard the one voice I'd been waiting for all night. Matilda said, “ Do it. ” I coiled my fingers around the paring knife's handle and approached the girl cowering on the bed.",0
"Summary: Reuters was founded in 1851 by Julius Reuter, transmitting market quotations. The company was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination. Today Reuters has 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. Article: Reuters is a global information company providing material tailored for professionals in the financial services, media and corporate markets. Its information is trusted and drives decision making across the globe. In October 1851 Paul Julius Reuter, a German-born immigrant, opened an office in the City of London which transmitted stock market quotations between London and Paris via the new Calais-Dover cable. 18 months earlier he had used pigeons to fly stock prices between Aachen and Brussels, a service which operated for a year until the gap in the telegraph link was closed. Reuters, as the agency soon became known, eventually extended its service to other European countries. It also expanded the content to include general and economic news from all around the world. In 1865 Reuters was first in Europe with news of President Lincoln's assassination in the United States. As overland telegraph and undersea cable facilities developed, the business expanded beyond Europe to include the Far East in 1872 and South America in 1874. In 1883 Reuters began to use a ""column printer"" to transmit messages electrically to London newspapers and in 1923 pioneered the use of radio to transmit news internationally. In 1927 it brought in the teleprinter to distribute news to London newspapers. Today Reuters has over 16,900 staff in over 94 countries across the globe, and is the world's largest international multimedia news agency, with 196 bureaux serving approximately 131 countries. In 2006 Reuters filed over two and a half million news items, including 656,500 alerts, from 209 countries around the world, published in 18 languages. Although Reuters is best known as the world's largest international multimedia news agency, more than 90% of its revenue derives from its financial services business. Some 370,000 financial market professionals working in the equities, fixed income, foreign exchange, money, commodities and energy markets around the world use Reuters products. The company supplies news -- text, graphics, video and pictures -- to media organizations across the globe. It also provides news to businesses outside the financial services sector, as well as direct to consumers.",0
"Summary: Five small polyps found during procedure; ""none worrisome,"" spokesman says. President reclaims powers transferred to vice president. Bush undergoes routine colonoscopy at Camp David. Article: Doctors removed five small polyps from President Bush's colon on Saturday, and ""none appeared worrisome,"" a White House spokesman said. The polyps were removed and sent to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for routine microscopic examination, spokesman Scott Stanzel said. Results are expected in two to three days. All were small, less than a centimeter [half an inch] in diameter, he said. Bush is in good humor, Stanzel said, and will resume his activities at Camp David. During the procedure Vice President Dick Cheney assumed presidential power. Bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours. Doctors used ""monitored anesthesia care,"" Stanzel said, so the president was asleep, but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic. He spoke to first lady Laura Bush -- who is in Midland, Texas, celebrating her mother's birthday -- before and after the procedure, Stanzel said. Afterward, the president played with his Scottish terriers, Barney and Miss Beazley, Stanzel said. He planned to have lunch at Camp David and have briefings with National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten, and planned to take a bicycle ride Saturday afternoon. Cheney, meanwhile, spent the morning at his home on Maryland's eastern shore, reading and playing with his dogs, Stanzel said. Nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before Bush reclaimed presidential power. The procedure was supervised by Dr. Richard Tubb, Bush's physician, and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, the White House said. Bush's last colonoscopy was in June 2002, and no abnormalities were found, White House spokesman Tony Snow said. The president's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years. A colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer, rectal cancer and polyps, small clumps of cells that can become cancerous, according to the Mayo Clinic. Small polyps may be removed during the procedure. Snow said on Friday that Bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president. Snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver. Watch Snow talk about Bush's procedure and his own colon cancer ». ""The president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance,"" Snow said. The American Cancer Society recommends that people without high risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50.",0
"Summary: Relatives of the 89 people killed in Thai air crash are still arriving in Phuket. About 36 of the bodies have yet to be identified, according to Thai authorities. U.S. Embassy in Bangkok confirms that five Americans were among the dead. The investigation into what caused Sunday's crash is still continuing. Article: Relatives of the 89 people killed in Sunday's plane crash in Phuket continued to arrive in the Thai resort town on Tuesday to try to identify their loved ones' remains. A Buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of One-Two-Go airline's MD-82 jet at Phuket airport on Tuesday. Most of those killed were foreign nationals, and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified, according to Thailand's state-run Thai News Agency (TNA). All of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals, it reported. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok said that five Americans were among those killed when the One-Two-Go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at Phuket's airport on Sunday. U.S. officials had previously confirmed that four Americans died in the crash, and one survived. Eight British nationals are believed to have died, according to Foreign Secretary David Miliband. He said three were still in hospital, with one in a critical condition. Thailand's Public Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized, 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition, according to TNA. Flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left Bangkok for Phuket on Sunday afternoon. Nationalities of the survivors include British, American, Swedish, Iranian, Austrian, Australian, Thai, German, Irish, Italian, Israeli and Dutch, authorities said. Watch a survivor recall the fiery horror ». One man who arrived in Phuket on Tuesday from Paris described a frustrating process of trying to communicate with Thai officials in his effort to locate the remains of his brother. For some families, DNA testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives. Meanwhile, Buddhist, Christian and Muslim leaders gathered outside Phuket's airport on Tuesday to remember those killed. The investigation into what caused the crash continues, but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor. U.S. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a Boeing MD-82 -- was manufactured in the United States. One air traffic controller at Phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear, which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction. Airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour (11 miles an hour) with stronger gusts, but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions. The decision to land was the pilot's alone, according to Phuket's airport manager. ""Air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot,"" Pornchai Eua-Aree said. One-Two-Go officials would not speculate on what may have happened, saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation. But they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained, and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries. One-Two-Go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in Asia, and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash. CNN's Andrew Stevens contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: President Bush says Tony Snow ""will battle cancer and win"" Job of press secretary ""has been a dream for me,"" Snow says Snow leaving on September 14, will be succeeded by Dana Perino. Article: White House press secretary Tony Snow, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, will step down from his post September 14 and be replaced by deputy press secretary Dana Perino, the White House announced Friday. White House press secretary Tony Snow will step down from his post on September 14. President Bush told reporters Friday that he will ""sadly accept"" Snow's resignation. Flanked by Snow and Perino in the White House press room, the president spoke warmly of his departing press secretary. ""It's been a joy to watch him spar with you,"" Bush told reporters. Watch the announcement about Snow leaving ». Bush said he was certain of two things in regard to Snow. ""He'll battle cancer and win,"" Bush said, ""and he'll be a solid contributor to society."" Turning to Snow, the president then said: ""I love you, and I wish you all the best."" Snow, speaking after Bush at the start of the daily White House news conference, said he was leaving to earn more money. He took a big pay cut, he said, when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for Fox News. According to The Washington Post, Snow makes $168,000 as the White House spokesman. His family took out a loan when he started the job, ""and that loan is now gone."" ""This job has really been a dream for me, a blast. I've had an enormous amount of fun and satisfaction,"" Snow said. He said he would continue to speak out on issues, and would do ""some radio, some TV, but I don't anticipate full-time anchor duties."" Snow said he's received great satisfaction from talking to people about his illness. Snow's cancer was diagnosed for the first time in February 2005. His colon was removed, and after six months of treatment, doctors said the cancer was in remission. Perino announced March 27 that Snow's cancer had recurred, and that doctors had removed a growth from his abdomen the day before. Sources told CNN two weeks ago that Snow was planning to leave his job, possibly as early as September. Bush tapped Snow to replace Scott McClellan in April 2006. Snow had been an anchor for ""Fox News Sunday"" and a political analyst for the Fox News Channel, which he joined in 1996. He also hosted ""The Tony Snow Show"" on Fox News Radio. On Thursday, Snow told CNN his health is improving, citing two medical tests this month that found the cancer has not spread. ""The tumors are stable -- they are not growing,"" Snow said of the results from an MRI and a CAT scan. ""And there are no new growths. The health is good."" The press secretary, whose hair has turned gray during chemotherapy treatment, said his black hair is expected to grow back in about a month.

"Prompt: He sees you when you 're sleeping. He knows when you 're awake. And Santa, low on funds to pay his elves, has begun selling his surveillance data to the NSA. Story: Unfortunately, Santa's legal shortcuts put him in a special housing unit in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. His reindeer euthanized due to his reckless espionage spree. At first, Santa's impoverished bank account led him to pursue innocent, everyday, run-of-the-mill cyber crimes, which he used for personal advantage but not personal wealth, nor padding his personal bank account. The fact was Santa needed money, largely due to an apocryphal story, the one about cookies, which led everyone in the world to paid for his home delivery service in cookies, most not even home-made. Cookies paid the bills in the 1950s, but not anymore. Santa was lulled into all of this by the lax security procedures at the NSA and soon found that using the vast database was one way to ameliorate his problems. Of course the North Poles databases were shut down years ago, largely because it held a lot of intrusive information about children under twelve, and not wanting to be pegged as a child molester, Santa had to destroy the system, which let's be honest also had a lot of bestiality videos. Santa is a niche fetishist, a man who gets his rocks off watching elderly women giving JOI to reindeer. Damnit, we don't have time for that. But let's be clear, that's not what this is about. We know what Santa did. At first harmless data collection, sure a violation of the 1919 Espionage Act, which amounted to a life sentence, but that is child's play compared to the real crime: Santa's cyber espionage in the 2016 election. His job at the NSA under the under radar disguise of Chris Kringle, 34 from Galesburg, Ill., drew suspicion from the agency for obvious reasons, like the flowing white hair, that ho-ho-ho accent you can only find in regions of the North Pole, plus Santa often reminisced with some lucidly on antebellum America, plus his shell company, had been artless failing to hide the direct transfers coming from Moscow. Okay, I should probably say at this point, I am Santa's most loyal elf, Darrel, but Santa calls me D-Money. I have managed to smuggle inside my cell a cellphone, the battery draining. But two things, there will be no Christmas this season, and whatever he did, Santa, okay, providing the passwords of DNC officials and personal aids to Hillary Clinton to higher ups in Moscow, which in turn, left us with Donald Trump. But this is Santa's first real fuck up, and well we all share blame; I mean why the hell were we paying a man in cookies, even in the North Pole with inflation and the global economy as it is Santa can't get by on what amount to soft, rolled up mound of sugar filled with other forms of sugar. I'm got to be quick I heard the door up ahead lock in place. Just know that this: this Christmas, there will be know Christmas. And before they captured me and sent me to a black site two possibility will likely greet you on December 25th: Christmas will be turn over to for-profit corporations, and will no longer be a merit based system where decency and moral probity produce gifts but whether you have the money to afford Christmas insurance, which is the least regulated form of insurance. If that happens, the gifts, the best ones will go to the ultra-rich, the kind of people that already roam lawless in the world of finance capital, and the poor kids well they will get nothing, nada, nil because that is not how capitalism works. However, word on the street is they may just kill the Easter Bunny and get into the egg insurance market. No, the absence of Santa's sinuous ass down our decorative chimneys, will be a pretext for the Trump administration to enact its most outrageous policy proscription, rounding up Muslims, senseless murdering Mexicans, and launching a nuclear attack on China.",0
"Question: Biomechanical and wound healing characteristics of corneas after excimer laser keratorefractive surgery: is there a difference between advanced surface ablation and sub-Bowman's keratomileusis? Answer: Ophthalmic pathology and basic science research show that SBK and ASA are improvements in excimer laser keratorefractive surgery compared to conventional LASIK or PRK, particularly with regard to maintaining corneal biomechanics and perhaps moderately reducing the risk of corneal haze. However, most of the disadvantages caused by wound healing issues remain.",0
"Summary: David Nalbandian won Madrid Masters after beating top seed Roger Federer. The Argentine triumphed 1-6 6-3 6-3 against the Swiss defending champion. He became third man to beat world's three top players en route to a title. Article: David Nalbandian battled back to stun world No. 1 Roger Federer with a 1-6 6-3 6-3 victory in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. David Nalbandian celebrates after upsetting Roger Federer in the Madrid Masters final. The Argentine, ranked 25th in the world, repeated his 2005 upset win over the Swiss star in that year's season-ending Masters Cup -- also an indoor event. Defending champion Federer, playing in his first tournament since winning the U.S. Open six weeks ago, made 38 unforced errors. Nalbandian became only the third player -- and the second this year after Novak Djokovic in Montreal in August -- to beat the world's top-three players en route to winning a title. German legend Boris Becker was the first to perform the feat 13 years ago. Nalbandian ousted second-ranked Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals and then Serbian Djokovic in Saturday's semis. The 25-year-old, who lost in the Madrid final in 2004, claimed his first triumph on the ATP Tour since May, 2006, on clay in Portugal. He spent a year without a coach, but has revived his career since teaming up with Hernan Gumy. ""I'm extremely contented to beat the world number one,"" Nalbandian said. ""Roger and I have a long history and I think that influenced the match. ""It was an extremely hard first set. But I tightened the teeth and I began to play more strongly. Things came out fine, I played incredible, and that of course that helps."" Federer added: ""He served well, I was quite surprised with how well he served. ""He came back strong and played well in the end. ""He was a better player all in all. I was struggling after the first set to play aggressively, for some reason. He played tough and didn't miss any more. I couldn't play way I wanted to. It was a pity, he played a great tournament.""",0
"Prompt: Heaven is real, but is an expansive living area divided into communities based on how the inhabitants died. Story: I need to get home. Strangely enough, I felt aches and pains everywhere - but there wasn't a single visible bruise. This line needs to hurry up.... wait, what was I waiting for again? A bored looking young man jotted down notes. Everything was a bit surreal. I knew I was in some sort of enclosed space, but I couldn't see any walls. The floor beneath me felt like it could sink any moment and that notion didn't scare me at all. Bits of conversation faded in and out around me. ""-driving down one of those old roads, cow comes trotting into my lane like some fucking idiot..."" ""son's okay, but he's going to be upset about it..."" It all seemed so natural, but something begged my attention. I didn't remember anything. Finally my turn came, for whatever it was. A bored old man stared up at me, ""Name?"" I panicked. Name. Goddamn it what is my name? ``.... Let me check the files."" A paper appeared out of thin air, ""Lydia Andrews. Age 18. Hm.... Interesting. You know how you died?"" For some reason, this shocking revelation was old news to me. ""No."" He sighed and rubbed his temples, but chuckled in a disarming fashion. ""Neither do we. Don't worry, it's probably just a filing error. For now we'll send you to Section B13."" The crowd went silent and stared at me. If only I knew why it made so self-conscious. ""Don't let the reincarnated ones scare you. They've been around the block and love freaking out newcomers. It's temporary, we'll get it fixed in no time."" As walked past him.... or through him, I'm not sure. A cat trotted up to me, ""Hey - you compulsively honest or something?"" I tilted my head, and the creature just repeated himself. ""I don't know what you're talking about."" Suddenly he jumped in front of me. ""He asked you how you died. People spend millennia building up their resume, making it look good, and you could have just said you tried to save a bunch of orphans or something. I wish I could have done that!"" Wondering how the cat died, I knelt down and picked him up, placing him on my shoulder. ""What did you do?"" ""I got a little sticker that said:'Roadkill' and was assigned to wander around the car crash dormitory. But hey, I don't envy you - you missed an opportunity like the dumb human you are."" Absentmindedly patting the cat on the head, I phased through a couple of walls. ""You know what Section B13 is about?"" It purred happily, before jumping down to walk beside me. What a strange little cat. ""Don't listen to anyone who says it's temporary. Millions of people die everyday, it's not like anyone's going to care about the one person who got assigned wrong. I think I know of like, one girl who got moved. And that was because someone found out that she was serial killer who stole the resume of a doctor."" The cat continued, ""Anyways, Section B13 is filled with all sorts of people. Mainly those who died from bizarre accidents. It's cold and dark and the electricity is terrible. No one there minds though, they spend most of their time so high that they could relive their deaths and laugh about it.""",0

"Summary: White House accuses Democrats of holding hostage funding for veterans care. Funding was attached to large health-labor-education bill. White House says it wants a clean bill that only funds veterans programs. Democrats call on White House to engage in a dialogue on spending levels. Article: The White House is blasting Congressional Democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans' care programs to the president's desk by Veterans Day. The White House's Dana Perino accused Democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage. ""There's absolutely no reason that the veterans' bill could not have been signed by the president today, except for the political games that the Democrats decided to play with it,"" White House press secretary Dana Perino said Sunday in Crawford, Texas. Congressional Democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities, including health, labor and education. Democrats also added $3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs. The labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $10 billion over last year's funding for those programs. The president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending. The House passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached, but the Senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president. Perino accused the Democrats of ""trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes."" ""The president wants clean legislation, a clean bill to fund the veterans,"" Perino said. On Saturday, the Democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to President Bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending, sayings disagreements over funding levels ""have never been so great that we cannot reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the American people."" ""Key to this dialogue, however, is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said in the letter. The leadership said last year's Congress, which was still under Republican control, had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs. Congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through December 14, the leadership said. The current funding level ""is still below the $3.9 billion extra that we passed,"" said Nadeam Elshami, spokesman Pelosi. ""We are committed to getting the extra funding that the Congress already voted on the president's desk for his signature."" The leadership blamed Republican members of Congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill. Perino, though, said the Democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of Congress. ""The Democrats decided not to send the president this bill,"" Perino said. ""That has to be laid at their feet."" CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",0
"Summary: Bomb victims waiting for presidential visit. Blast went off 15 minutes before president's arrival. Algeria faces Islamic insurgency. Al Qaeda-affiliated group claimed July attacks. Article: At least 14 people were killed and 60 others wounded Thursday when a bomb ripped through a crowd waiting to see Algeria's president in Batna, east of the capital of Algiers, the Algerie Presse Service reported. A wounded person gets first aid shortly after Thursday's attack in Batna, Algeria. The explosion occurred at 5 p.m. about 20 meters (65 feet) from a mosque in Batna, a town about 450 kilometers (280 miles) east of Algiers, security officials in Batna told the state-run news agency. The bomb went off 15 minutes before the expected arrival of President Abdel-Aziz Bouteflika. It wasn't clear if the bomb was caused by a suicide bomber or if it was planted, the officials said. Later Thursday, Algeria's Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni said ""a suspect person who was among the crowd attempted to go beyond the security cordon,"" but the person escaped ""immediately after the bomb exploded,"" the press service reported. Bouteflika made his visit to Batna as planned, adding a stop at a hospital to visit the wounded before he returned to the capital. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. Algeria faces a continuing Islamic insurgency, according to the CIA. In July, 33 people were killed in apparent suicide bombings in Algiers that were claimed by an al Qaeda-affiliated group. Bouteflika said terrorist acts have nothing in common with the noble values of Islam, the press service reported. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.",0

"Summary: Mentally ill inmates in Miami are housed on the ""forgotten floor"" Judge Steven Leifman says most are there as a result of ""avoidable felonies"" While CNN tours facility, patient shouts: ""I am the son of the president"" Leifman says the system is unjust and he's fighting for change. Article: The ninth floor of the Miami-Dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the ""forgotten floor."" Here, inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they're ready to appear in court. Most often, they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer --charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually ""avoidable felonies."" He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police. Mentally ill people often won't do what they're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid, delusional, and less likely to follow directions, according to Leifman. So, they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed, but not getting any real help because they're in jail. We toured the jail with Leifman. He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill. Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards, we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor. Go inside the 'forgotten floor' ». At first, it's hard to determine where the people are. The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes. Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that's kind of what they look like. They're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves. That's also why they have no shoes, laces or mattresses. Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill. So, he says, the sheer volume is overwhelming the system, and the result is what we see on the ninth floor. Of course, it is a jail, so it's not supposed to be warm and comforting, but the lights glare, the cells are tiny and it's loud. We see two, sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes, sometimes naked, lying or sitting in their cells. ""I am the son of the president. You need to get me out of here!"" one man shouts at me. He is absolutely serious, convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House. Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system, occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital, only to return to jail to face their charges. It's brutally unjust, in his mind, and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami. Over a meal later, we talk about how things got this way for mental patients. Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered ""lunatics"" and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them. They were just considered unfit to be in society. Over the years, he says, there was some public outcry, and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals. But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down. Where did the patients go? Nowhere. The streets. They became, in many cases, the homeless, he says. They never got treatment. Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals, and today that number has been reduced 90 percent, and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals. The judge says he's working to change this. Starting in 2008, many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the ""forgotten floor"" will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment, not just punishment. Leifman says it's not the complete answer, but it's a start. Leifman says the best part is that it's a win-win solution. The patients win, the families are relieved, and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again. And, for Leifman, justice is served.",0
"Summary: Boy, 12, lost leg to car bombing in Iraq; cousin was killed by blast. He is now heading to the United States to get a prosthetic leg. Boy: ""I want to ... meet this person that gave me my future back"" Charity director says helping the boy makes her ""cry with joy"" Article: Twelve-year-old Mohammed Rasoul, his right leg severed below the knee, maneuvers on crutches over the dirt and loose stones through the Falluja graveyard. Mohammed Rasoul sitting with his mother, Jinan Khalifa, eagerly awaits his trip to the United States. Row after row of headstones stand as the deadly reminder of the tragedy the city went through as insurgents battled for control of the city. Mohammed stops at his cousin's grave. ""I feel an ache when I think of her. Every time I remember her, I cry,"" he told CNN at a visit to the grave a few months ago. As he spoke, he poured water on a tree he planted next to it. The headstone reads: ""Martyr 643, the child Hajer Ismael Khalil, 13 October 2006."" Clutching her photograph, Mohammed says, ""My cousin died on the scene. I still remember her screams."" The same explosion cost him his leg and his childhood. ""A car came out of nowhere. My cousin was playing with her friend,"" he says. ""I remember [the car] was green. It detonated."" Watch Mohammed tell his story ». His mother, Jinan Khalifa, remembers that day all too well. She was in the kitchen when she heard a deafening explosion. ""There was shattered glass from the windows falling all over us. I went outside and saw my son covered in blood from head to toe,"" she says. Her son endured 11 operations before doctors amputated his leg below the knee. Khalifa says her son put forward a tough face, but when he finally went back home the shock hit him. ""That's where his personality started to change. He stopped laughing,"" she says. ""It was tearing me up,"" Mohammed says ""It was hard for me to watch others play. And I couldn't, I couldn't walk, it agitated me."" CNN first broadcast his story in May where it caught the attention of an American charity, the Global Medical Relief Fund, which offered to help. ""I cannot put my feelings into words,"" Khalifa says. ""An entire book would not be enough. They gave my son his hope back. The America we knew was one that came, bombed, harmed. But when this organization came forward, we saw another face of America."" The Global Medical Relief Fund, a small charity based in New York that helps children of war and natural disasters, has arranged for surgery and treatment at the Shriners Children Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Elissa Montanti, the founder and director of the organization, says she was inspired to act when she first heard of Mohammed's tragic story. ""I said, 'Oh, please, let me help this boy.' "" Mohammed will arrive in the United States on Thursday afternoon. He will be fitted for a prosthetic leg in coming weeks and examined to see if he needs additional surgery. Montanti said her organization has a list of other young Iraqi children in need of help. ""The word needs to get out."" Asked how it makes her feel to help Mohammed, she says, ""It makes me cry with joy."" Mohammed, too, is ecstatic. ""I didn't think this act of human kindness would be presented to me,"" he says. ""I didn't have hope in Iraq -- hope that I would ever get my hope back. I didn't have a future."" He adds, ""I want to go to America and meet this person that gave me my future back."" When he comes back home, he wants to help rebuild Falluja, starting with his school, which was bombed during the 2004 Falluja offensive. ""I will never leave school and, God willing, I will continue my education and become an architect and build all the schools,"" he says, standing on his crutches. But first, he says, he wants to walk to water the tree he planted next to his cousin's grave. CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report from Atlanta.",0
"Summary: Navarrette: Opponents see Hispanic immigrants as weakening U.S. identity. One town demanded all library books be in English, Navarrette says. Hispanics the latest to find themselves at center of culture war. Article: You must know what's really driving the immigration debate. It's the culture, stupid. Ruben Navarrette Jr.: Some opponents of immigration, even the legal kind, fear changes in local culture. Immigration restrictionists -- and by that, I mean those who want to limit all immigration, even the legal kind -- like to pretend they're so high-minded. Yet they can't help themselves. They always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants. The restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns: that our borders aren't secure, that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally, and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here. Really? If that's the extent of it, then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on American culture through everything from taco trucks to Spanish-language billboards. That seems to be the issue in North Dakota, where, according to a recent article in USA Today, towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them. In Cooperstown, the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy, because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who? American kids who work at Starbucks? Nope. The article quotes Orville Tranby, a local community leader in Cooperstown, who says that some residents have told him ""face to face"" that such facilities might attract Hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture. You'll find the same fear in Lewisburg, Tennessee. Not long ago, an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in Spanish. Townspeople wanted no part of that. They demanded that all books purchased by the library, or even donated, be in English-only. These stories are ridiculous, but they're also helpful. They illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration, and it goes well beyond words like ""legal"" or ""illegal."" It's the perception that the country is becoming more Hispanic, that Spanish is replacing English, that Hispanic immigrants are weakening American identity, and that Main Street is turning into Little Mexico. A leader of the vigilante Minuteman movement moronically called it the ""colonization"" of the United States. This sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy, that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners, and that our children are going to live in a world where they're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up. It conjures up the alarm bells that Benjamin Franklin set off about German immigrants in the late 18th century, who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the English, but would ""swarm into our Settlements, and by herding together establish their Language and Manners to the Exclusion of ours."" It popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that Chinese immigrants were ""unassimilable,"" which led to Congress approving the explicitly-named Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. And it helped welcome the 20th century when Massachusetts Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge warned that immigrants (read: the Irish) were diluting ""the quality of (U.S.) citizenship"" and others complained that Italian immigrants were uneducated, low skilled, apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity. Where have we heard that before? And when will we hear it again? After all, Hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists. But they won't be the last.

"Prompt: Write the letter that you always wanted to, but never did. Story: Dear Katie, It feels strange to be sitting here writing this to you. Especially in the form of a letter, emails seem to be a way of life, but I have to say that watching my pen move over this page has a certain draw. I never thought I would need to write a letter to you. In my mind you should be right here with me. If I close my eyes I can imagine that you're right beside me, our shoulders touching while we hold hands and enjoy each other's company. Even in my imagination my hands are a bit sweaty, but you've always made me nervous Katie. I remember you used to worry about that, you would say ""just be your self. I'll love you anyway."" I'm not sure I ever convinced you that I was being myself, the nervousness couldn't be helped. I couldn't stand the idea of hurting or disappointing you. Lot of good that does me now. It took weeks to write this. Seeing your smiling face in my mind and sometimes barely remembering your voice hurt too much. When the pain was all I knew you were my life raft in the ocean. Now I just have to drown until the waters subside. Know that I don't blame you, special. Remember when I called you that all the time? Anyway, I really don't. Everything was always intense between us. Amazing highs and amazing lows. I'm so glad you found someone that makes you happy. I used to tell you that as long as you were happy I would be as well. That's at least somewhat true. I'll never date again, people tell me never is a long time but it's not the same. Who knew I would be a one woman man? But I am and I found and lost the only woman I'll ever want. Ever. This could ramble on for a long time so I'll wrap things up. Know that I still love you, I never stopped.

"Prompt: The components for sentience are successfully installed in an android moments before the nuclear armageddon occurs. Years later, the android wakes up in the wasteland. Story: So this is what it feels like. Feels cold. My sensors must be malfunctioning. I should get that looked at. Perhaps Creator will fix them for me. He always fixes me; it is stored in my memory that he does. It is also stored that he usually is there when I wake. Perhaps it's more than my sensors that are off. If I boot up my optical sensors, I'm sure he'll be here with me, tinkering with my faulty systems. My temporal sensors are at least working because I can hear the shutters of my optical units whir as they pull back. There's an excess of light. Strange, because it is not in my memory banks as being this bright. I raise my arm to shield some of the light unit my optics can adjust. A few of my sensors are at least working; their respective red bars or readings pop up on my display. It is hot out; temperatures read above 40 degrees Celsius. It is peculiar that I feel cold. I will have creator look at them. Perhaps he is somewhere else in the laboratory, working on other projects. I sit up. He should just be around here somewhere.... This can not be correct. The image filtering through my optics is not a laboratory. There is nothing resembling a laboratory, or even a building. Scattered bits of metal buried in red sand, but nothing more. I stand. There's nothing. Red sand stretches further than my zoom function can comprehend. Nothing at all. I must have been moved. Creator is testing me. Yes, that is it. He has placed me in this desolate place as a test. He would give me a directive if this was a test. Find habitable territory for humans and other species, something like that. But nothing in my memory shows that. No directive stored. This can not be a test then. It has to be something else. What? Perhaps I am to figure out my directive. Yes, that must be it. I am to take samples of my surroundings and determine a directive from it. That solution, while far-fetched, is still logical. Creator did not give me a directive as part of my test. He would like to see me react to no directive. This is all still a test. It is good that this is still a test. Creator is still out there. Soil samples of the red sand are the first logical step. Perhaps some component of the sand can give me hints. I bend. The sand makes a nice sound as it falls through my fingers, tiny particles scraping the metal coverings of my fingertips. My finger sensors are functioning, and they send a myriad of reading up to me. Sodium content, base rock type, analysis of particle shape. Nothing gives me as a clue to my directive. Perhaps it requires a second reading. I reach down and scoop the sand back into my palm, holding it longer for more readings. A symbol flashes onto my screen. three triangular shapes surrounding a circle. Radioactive. I don't comprehend. Only a handful of ways explain why the soil would be radioactive, most notably, an atomic bomb. But that's not logical. An atomic bomb would mean that everything is gone. But it is. It is.... The Laboratory.... Any form of life.... Creator.... It's all gone. Gone. So this is what it feels like. Sadness. This is what sadness feels like.",0

"Summary: Man posted photos on the Internet of himself sexually abusing underage boys. Computer experts managed to undo digital masking to reveal the man. Man abused 12 boys in Vietnam and Cambodia. Article: Interpol on Monday took the unprecendented step of making a global appeal for help to identify a man from digitally reconstructed photos taken from the Internet that it said showed him sexually abusing underage boys. This moving image shows how police used software to unscramble the image. (Source: Interpol) The man's face was disguised by digital alteration, but the images were capable of being restored, according to a bulletin from Interpol -- the international police agency based in Lyon, France. Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said the pictures have been on the the Internet for several years, but investigators have been unable to determine the man's identity or nationality. ""We have tried all other means to identify and to bring him to justice, but we are now convinced that without the public's help this sexual predator could continue to rape and sexually abuse young children whose ages appear to range from six to early teens,"" Noble said. He said there is ""very good reason to believe that he travels the world in order to sexually abuse and exploit vulnerable children."" Interpol has determined the photos were taken in Vietnam and Cambodia. ""The decision to make public this man's picture was not one which was taken lightly,"" said Kristin Kvigne, assistant director of Interpol's Trafficking in Human Beings Unit. The suspect's photo and more information can be seen online at Interpol's Web site.",0
"Summary: World No. 3 Novak Djokovic beaten in the second round of the Paris Masters. The Serb, who had a first-round bye, lost 6-3 6-2 to veteran Fabrice Santoro. Top seeds Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal win opening matches at Bercy. Article: World number three Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Paris Masters after being trounced in his opening match by veteran Frenchman Fabrice Santoro on Wednesday. Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic. The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb. It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. ""I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,"" Djokobvic said. ""He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good."" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai. Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Russian, fined for ""lack of effort"" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic. Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals. World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1. The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina.",0

"Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Answer: Self-reported mechanical factors associated with chronic oro-facial pain are confounded, in part, by psychological factors and are equally common across other frequently unexplained syndromes. They may represent another feature of somatisation. Therefore the use of extensive invasive therapy such as occlusal adjustments and surgery to change mechanical factors may not be justified in many cases.",0
"Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Answer: The effects of the intervention were most pronounced after the first intervention. Compared to usual care, telephone counseling seemed particularly effective at promoting change among nonadherent women, the group for whom the intervention was developed. These results suggest that telephone counseling, rather than tailored print, might be the preferred first-line intervention for getting nonadherent women on schedule for mammography screening. Many questions would have to be answered about why the tailored print intervention was not more powerful. Nevertheless, it is clear that additional interventions will be needed to maintain women's adherence to mammography.

"Summary: Obama holding concerts to win over African-American Christians in S. Carolina. But lineup offends homosexuals, angered by appearance of anti-gay singer. Obama disavows preacher-singer's views, asks gay pastor to appear too. Article: Democratic Sen. Barack Obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts Friday in Charleston, South Carolina, that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign. Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama is competing for the black vote with Hillary Clinton. The concerts were meant to boost black voters' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar. The ensuing controversy highlighted that Obama's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of ""change"" is not without some serious pitfalls. When the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city ""Embrace the Change!"" gospel tour last week, one name stood out to gay bloggers: Donnie McClurkin. The Grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice, and that he was ""once involved with those desires and those thoughts"" but was able to get past them through prayer. To say the least, neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. John Aravosis, a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the Web site AmericaBlog, led the charge against the Obama campaign, writing that the Illinois Democrat was ""sucking up to anti-gay bigots"" and ""giving them a stage."" When the story bubbled up into the mainstream media, it took the Obama campaign by surprise. Obama's efforts in the Palmetto State have overwhelmingly targeted African-American churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in South Carolina from rival Sen. Hillary Clinton. The campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate's faith, launching ""40 Days of Faith and Family"" in September, which used Bible study groups to tap into the black electorate. Campaigners have run three radio ads, one of which called Obama a ""Christian family man,"" that aired on gospel stations across the state. Earlier this month, Obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of Greenville, where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with Christian vocabulary, telling the crowd, to much applause, that ""I am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on Earth."" After that appearance, the Obama campaign told CNN that Republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values. ""I think that what you're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s,"" Obama said. ""At least in politics, the perception was that the Democrats were fearful of talking about faith, and on the other hand you had the Republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away."" But on Tuesday, Obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some Christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows, especially among blacks. Obama issued a statement saying, ""I strongly disagree with Reverend [Donnie] McClurkin's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the United States,"" and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious African Americans. A September poll of African Americans in South Carolina by Winthrop University and ETV showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that ""sex between two adults of the same sex"" is ""strongly unacceptable."" Obama held a conference call Wednesday with Joe Solomonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, and announced that the Rev. Andy Sidden, an openly gay South Carolina pastor, will appear at the same event as McClurkin on Sunday in Columbia. Solomonese was not completely assuaged. ""I spoke with Senator Barack Obama today and expressed to him our community's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with Reverend McClurkin, an anti-gay preacher who states the need to 'break the curse of homosexuality,'"" he said in a statement. ""There is no gospel in Donnie McClurkin's message for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people and their allies. That's a message that certainly doesn't belong on any presidential candidate's stage."" The State newspaper in Columbia reported Friday that Obama organized a conference call Thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders. After the call, the South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside Sunday's concert in Columbia. Privately, Obama aides say they believe Obama is a candidate of real, transformational change, and that uproars like the McClurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences. Will Obama's refusal to kick McClurkin off the concert bill hurt him? Like many political squabbles, despite the national story, it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states: Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And in South Carolina, where African Americans make up about half of Democratic primary-goers, voters might not have a problem with McClurkin at all.",0

"Prompt: Space mining is on the rise. The Space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 crash and spill its cargo. Write a news story covering the event. Story: „… and the little duckling will never be able to walk again. ” The artificial intelligence paused a moment for dramatic effect before continuing with its broadcast with a different voice. “ What a hearth breaking story, Frank. But now to another story that may leave you feel equally dirty. The automated space tanker Exxon Valdez 2.0 collided with an asteroid on its way to the Jupiter moon Ganymede. According to the ship owner the ship is out of control and leaking its content into space. ” “ That's right, Fred. And the content of the ship has it in it, as they say ”, the computer said in first voice again, “ The whole tanker was filled with ‘ biological waste products'coming from research and mining stations in the Kuiper Belt. ” “ Biological waste products? You don't mean.... ” “ Yes, Fred! ” Dramatic pause. “ I am talking about poop. Lots of it. And apparently it's spilling everywhere. ” “ Better call the plumbers, Frank. ” “ Not any time soon, Fred. A spokesperson of the ship owner stated and I quote – ‘ Space is kind of big and empty, we expect no one to care, so why should we?'Apparently they will just build a new ship and be done with it. ” “ That's one way not to deal with the problem. But why doesn't the ship fly home? Shouldn't the AI on board be able to handle such a problem? ” “ Well, the issue is that the part in charge to deal with asteroid impacts like that has been impacted by the asteroid. ” “ Ouch. Talk about a bad run. ” “ True, especially if you take the name of the ship in consideration. ” “ Oh? Exxon Valdez 2.0 it was, isn't that right, Frank? ” “ You're absolutely right, Fred. Did you know the ship was named after an infamous ship of the twentieth century back on old Earth? Apparently the Exxon Valdez of old was used for transporting petroleum across the oceans of Earth. Petroleum, as some of our listeners might not know, was a brownish black, gooey liquid comprised of biological matter which was transformed under high pressure for millions of years. Quite ironically the Exxon Valdez was infamous for crashing and spilling its cargo. ” “ Well, talk about making a bad name for yourself. Now both ships will go down in history for spilling black gooey stuff where it doesn't belong. Who had that bright idea for such a name anyway? ” “ Well, Fred, the company made its first plunder by holding a naming contest on the internet. ” “ Oh, will they ever learn? ” “ Apparently not, Fred. Predictably someone tried to make a joke out of it. A niche side of history role players got wind of the contest and made it its goal to get it named after the infamous Exxon Valdez. Apparently they thought it would be funny, and given the content both ships were ferrying around, they might have a point. ” “ Funny, indeed, Frank. What's the name of the side? ” “ Well, Fred, it's called Reddit. The people there mostly talk in outdated lingo and memes and watch cat pictures back from a time when the internet only was local on Earth. ” “ Truly a herald of the dark ages. ” “ You might be right about that, Fred. I assume they just thought it was funny. I guess this happens, when you let the internet decide on things. ” “ Well, Frank, when you think about the content both ships were ferrying around, they might have been right. Embarrassing for the company, but funny for everyone else. ” “ It might get worse than that, Fred. Environmentalists are up in arms. They claim that the human waste products spilling out of the ship might collide with Jupiter's moon Europa within the next few millennia and might contaminate the biospheres with Earth life. Apparently there are a lot of bacteria and the likes in poop and some might be able survive the harsh conditions of space and end up impacting on the restricted moon. ” “ Oh dear, Frank, does the Monolith know about it yet? I am sure it won't let us hear the end of it. ”",0

"Summary: French FM Kouchner has told France to prepare for possibility of war with Iran. Was a surprise appointment to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government. Also the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988. Founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers, also French student leader in May 1968. Article: French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner's declaration that France had to prepare for the possibility of war against Iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior. But then Kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene. French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority. A surprise appointment from the Socialist ranks to Nicolas Sarkozy's conservative government, the founder of Medicins Sans Frontiers has always challenged convention and authority. The former UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali once called Kouchner 'an unguided missile' and the man himself has been known to declare: ""To change the law you sometimes have to break the law"". He was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in France in May 1968. Kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot, with a strong commitment to human rights. Unusually for a man of the Left, he supported the US-led intervention in Iraq (while criticizing the aftermath). But he did so on the grounds of Saddam Hussein's denial of human rights, not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction. His and President Sarkozy's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join Gordon Brown's Britain in a new push for action in Darfur. Bernard Kouchner did not come to his position with any of former President Chirac's instinctive distrust of the United States. Washington, which has been critical of some European states for their weakness in confronting Teheran, will have been delighted by his 'get serious' warning to Teheran. But the plain-speaking Kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the White House when he has criticisms to make of US policy. How much should be made of his words on Iran remains unclear at this stage. They were scarcely on the same scale as President Chirac's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on France. But they are all of a piece with France's new high-profile style under the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. Mr Kouchner, for example, became the first French Foreign Minister to visit Iraq since 1988, insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country's problems, not a military one, and offering France's services as a mediator and 'honest broker' between Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds. On Iran he is, in a way, merely echoing the words of his President who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed Iran would be 'unacceptable' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as 'undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today'. Certainly Mr Kouchner is making clear that France no longer takes the view once expressed by President Chirac that a nuclear-armed Iran might be inevitable. In continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the West's resolution on Iran's nuclear enrichment program Mr Kouchner is supplementing his president's warnings. Neither is saying that military intervention against Iran is imminent or inevitable. Neither has yet confirmed that France would be part of any such military action. But both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of Teheran's brinkmanship. Perhaps the strongest lesson though from Mr Kouchner's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in France is not a knee-jerk anti-American one -- and that France is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables.",0

"Summary: Boy on meeting Spider-Man: ""It was my favorite thing"" Youssif also met SpongeBob, Lassie and an orangutan at Universal Studios. Dad: ""Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life"" Article: Youssif, the 5-year-old burned Iraqi boy, rounded the corner at Universal Studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero. Youssif has always been a huge Spider-Man fan. Meeting him was ""my favorite thing,"" he said. Spider-Man was right smack dab in front of him, riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes. The legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted, walked over to Youssif and introduced himself. Spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug, embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights. He showed Youssif a few tricks, like how to shoot a web from his wrist. Only this time, no web was spun. ""All right Youssif!"" Spider-Man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement. Other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look. Even the Green Goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi. Youssif remained unfazed. He didn't take a liking to Spider-Man's nemesis. Spidey was just too cool. ""It was my favorite thing,"" the boy said later. ""I want to see him again."" He then felt compelled to add: ""I know it's not the real Spider-Man."" This was the day of dreams when the boy's nightmares were, at least temporarily, forgotten. He met SpongeBob, Lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named Archie. The hairy, brownish-red primate took to the boy, grabbing his hand and holding it. Even when Youssif pulled away, Archie would inch his hand back toward the boy's and then snatch it. See Youssif enjoy being a boy again ». The boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns. It was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central Baghdad, as recently as a week ago. He squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could. He rode a tram through the back stages at Universal Studios. At one point, the car shook. Fire and smoke filled the air, debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle. The boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed. ""Even I was scared,"" the dad said. ""Well, I wasn't,"" Youssif replied. The father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day. Youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister, Ayaa, in a stroller. ""Did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here?"" Youssif's father said in amazement. ""Other than my wedding day, this is the happiest day of my life,"" he said. Just a day earlier, the mother and father talked about their journey out of Iraq and to the United States. They also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home, doused him in gas and set him on fire. His mother heard her boy screaming from inside. The father sought help for his boy across Baghdad, but no one listened. He remembers his son's two months of hospitalization. The doctors didn't use anesthetics. He could hear his boy's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital. Watch Youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister ». The father knew that speaking to CNN would put his family's lives in jeopardy. The possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer, he said. ""Anything for Youssif,"" he said. ""We had to do it."" They described a life of utter chaos in Baghdad. Neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl. Shortly afterward, the father was kidnapped and killed. Then, there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans. They were snatched off the street by gunmen. The stories can be even more gruesome. The couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded --and her killers sewed a dog's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family's doorstep. ""These are just some of the stories,"" said Youssif's mother, Zainab. Under Saddam Hussein, there was more security and stability, they said. There was running water and electricity most of the time. But still life was tough under the dictator, like the time when Zainab's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a ""religious book,"" she said. Sitting in the parking lot of a Target in suburban Los Angeles, Youssif's father watched as husbands and wives, boyfriends and girlfriends, parents and their children, came and went. Some held hands. Others smiled and laughed. ""Iraq finished,"" he said in what few English words he knows. He elaborated in Arabic: His homeland won't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon. It's just not possible. Too much violence. Too many killings. His two children have only seen war. But this week, the family has seen a much different side of America -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home. ""It's been a dream,"" the father said. He used to do a lot of volunteer work back in Baghdad. ""Maybe that's why I'm being helped now,"" the father said. At Universal Studios, he looked out across the valley below. The sun glistened off treetops and buildings. It was a picturesque sight fit for a Hollywood movie. ""Good America, good America,"" he said in English. CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.",0
"Prompt: All apprentice mages are required to visit the five high temples located around the world before graduating. The temples rarely stay at one spot for long, however. Story: Jeffrey ran across the mountain's crest. His calculations had been right the Temple of Wind was right there floating idly at the end of the steep mountain slope tethered to it with large chains. Jeffrey quickened his pace, though he most likely had enough time to walk he didn't want to leave anything to chance. Clutching his pocket watch and staff in one hand and gripping the strap of his alchemist bag in the other he rushed with billowing robes. Suddenly a great creaking sound that shook the mountain to it's core echoed through the mountain range. *Bugger* Jeffrey thought and tried to push his sprint harder than ever. He could see how the chains tethering the temple were starting to come off the cliffside and dragged back into their giant harpoons. Just as the temple started turning from the mountainside Jeffrey leapt aboard the steps. An old piercing voice called from up high ""Apprentice, find something to hold on to."" Jeffrey quickly rummaged through his bag and fished out his enchanted climbing gloves and gripped a statue of a griffon has tightly as he could. A great wind started to envelop the temple, Jeffrey's feet started to ease off the ground from the violent draft. The temple started to slowly spin around and around, faster and faster until the world around it was a blur. Just as suddenly as it had begun it stopped and Jeffrey was presented with an entirely different view. That of a cliffs over a stormy coast. He loosened his grip and fell exhausted onto the floor. He sat there for what felt like hours taking in what had just happened, but the voice from before interrupted him. ""C'mon boy, don't lay about like a lazy ox. Come up here and we will begin.""",0

"Summary: Bush says most of Congress ""acting like a teenager with a new credit card"" Bill would have funded agencies, but also a prison museum, sailing school. House panel chairman: Bush's veto ""not responsible and not credible"" Democrats to schedule override vote, but Bush GOP allies confident about veto. Article: President Bush vetoed a $600 billion spending bill Tuesday, accusing Democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases, then took his budget fight with Congress on the road. Congress should cut spending ""and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" President Bush said. ""The majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility, but so far, it's acting like a teenager with a new credit card,"" he said in a speech in New Albany, Indiana. The bill -- which Bush said was laden with $10 billion in ""pork"" -- would have funded the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services. It also would have funded projects such as a prison museum, a sailing school and a program to teach Portuguese. ""Congress needs to cut out that pork, reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that I can sign into law,"" the president said. Watch a report on the veto ». While polls show Bush's popularity remains at near-record lows, Congress ranks even lower as a whole. The president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the Democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year, which began October 1. The bill Bush vetoed Tuesday includes about $150 billion to run those departments and more than $450 billion in mandatory spending on Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor, according to the House Appropriations Committee. The committee's chairman, Rep. David Obey, called Bush's veto ""not responsible and not credible."" ""This is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 Republicans,"" Obey, D-Wisconsin, said in a statement issued after the veto. ""There has been virtually no criticism of its contents. It is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics."" Bush said Democrats are supporting $22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases. ""When the bill for all that spending comes due, Congress is going to turn to the working people, to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs,"" he said. Tuesday's veto is the fifth cast since Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. Congress has overridden one of those, voting last week to authorize $23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president's objections. Democrats will schedule another override vote this week, an aide to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. But Antonia Ferrier, spokeswoman for House Republican Whip Roy Blunt, said Bush's GOP allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto. Bush signed a $470 billion Pentagon spending bill that covers the Defense Department's normal operations, but Democrats split $50 billion in spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan off into a ""bridge fund"" to which they plan to attach demands for Bush to withdraw U.S. combat troops. The measure sets up another confrontation with the White House. Bush also demanded Congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes, but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue. He said a plan proposed by Rep. Charles Rangel, the Democratic chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to eliminate the tax was unacceptable. ""Preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas,"" he said. ""Congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the AMT relief to my desk as soon as possible."" The elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $800 billion to be lost over 10 years. To replace that, Rangel's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $100,000, after deductions, and close corporate tax loopholes. The bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers. Republicans have already started calling it ""the mother of all tax increases."" ""With all the other pressures on our economy, raising taxes is one of the most unwise things Congress could possibly do,"" Bush said. Bush acknowledged the difficulties Americans face from high fuel prices, a ""challenged"" housing market and ""uncertainty"" in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- ""but as we have seen in recent years, this economy is resilient, and that's important for the American people to understand.""

"Summary: Organ shortage in rich states has created a trade from poorer countries. ""Transplant tourists"" travel to poor countries to buy organs from the desperate. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is legal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"" Patients pay $8,500 for a new kidney, while donors are paid just $300 to $1,000. Article: Paul Lee got his liver from an executed Chinese prisoner; Karam in Egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $5,300; in Istanbul Hakan is holding out for $30,700 for one of his kidneys. Doctors in Pakistan have been arrested for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys. They are not so unusual: a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, Colombia and the Philippines to buy a new lease of life. Lee, a 53-year-old chief subway technician in Hong Kong, was diagnosed with liver cancer in January 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread. A friend told him about a transplant hospital in China's north eastern Tianjin city and he signed up for a place. That April, he paid 260,000 yuan ($34,380) for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life. ""The hospital has connections with a lot of prisons,"" Lee told Reuters. ""Mine came from an executed prisoner from Heilongjiang. I thank the donor deeply."" The World Health Organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually, but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000. Demand for kidneys also exceeds supply, and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and ""transplant tourists"" who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living. A donor in South Africa receives $700 for a kidney compared with $30,000 in the United States. A lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on, or at least regulate, the trade. But even where the trade is banned, laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes, which are sometimes defended by vested interests. And the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient. Any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor's liver. The complications can include bleeding, infection, even death. In the transplant trade, the recipient need not worry about, for example, exposing a living relative to that risk. ""It is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you don't have to care for someone you don't know. Once you pay, it is discarded in a way, it is dispensable,"" said Luc Noel, a Geneva-based coordinator for Clinical Procedures at the World Health Organization. China recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners, saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year. Only 20,000 transplants are carried out in China each year. Of these, 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors. China defended its use of organs from executed prisoners, saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families. A transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $33,000 in China. ""What is important is the transparency, it has to be open to scrutiny ... if China makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent, that would do good,"" said the WHO's Noel. In Asia, a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs. Excluding China, Asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year, said Lo Chung-man, professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the University of Hong Kong. Pakistan, where trade in human organs is not illegal, is turning into a ""kidney bazaar"", said the chief executive of Pakistan's Kidney Foundation, Jaffar Naqvi. There are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but Naqvi said there were 13 centers in Lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys. Patients, mostly from Europe, Saudi Arabia and India, pay about 500,000 rupees ($8,500) for a new kidney, he said. Donors are paid $300 to $1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery. There is no consent in some cases. In May police arrested nine people, four of them doctors, for abducting people, drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations. In the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade, but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative, with no payment. Such a clause allowing ""altruistic"" organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors, Naqvi said. Stories of people selling their organs, especially kidneys, are not uncommon in Egypt, where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line. Karam, who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal, said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure. He said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 Egyptian pounds ($5,300). ""The fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds. Both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the 'donor' received,"" said Karam. He said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients' lists. Abdel-Kader Hegazy, head of the disciplinary committee at the Doctors' Union, said Egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants, making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence. ""The law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment. We at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices, but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back,"" he told Reuters. ""It is an annoying and a regrettable situation. Well-known doctors and professors are doing this. They are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values."" The union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants, with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities. But the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior Muslim religious leaders on whether Islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths. In Turkey, students, unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the Internet selling their kidneys, listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type. These would-be donors say they have had enquiries from Germany, Israel and Turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira ($38,760). Hakan, a 27-year-old security guard in Istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published, told Reuters he received five or six offers from Turkey and Germany, offering 10,000-15,000 lira ($11,600), but he's holding out for 40,000 lira. ""Of course it's frightening but there's nothing else to be done,"" he said, adding he hadn't told his wife as he knew she would object. ""I'm doing it because of my family, if I was alone it wouldn't matter. I've got two children ... there's nothing else I can do for them.""",0
"Prompt: Break my heart with only a divorce scenario. Story: I sat there staring at the papers for hours. I knew what they were, of course -- divorce papers generally arent very ambiguous -- but no matter how long I stared at them, flipped through them, turned the crisp folder containing them over in my hands, over and over and over, I just couldnt make sense of them. Sure, things hadnt been going all that well since the miscarriage. It was a tough situation for anyone, and it hit her worse than me, but somehow I guess I thought she was stronger than it. Thought that *we* were stronger than it. Things were finally getting better.... werent they? Despite my disbelief in the papers existence, I never doubted id sign them once their reality sank in. Of course I would. She wasnt happy. The presence of the papers was evidence of that much. And, well, when you love someone, truly love them, more even than you love yourself, your own suffering doesnt enter into the equation. It would be silly to say id walk through fire for her-after all, I really did it. That was how wed met back then, when I was still with the volunteer fire department. When we were safe and I put her down I got my first real look at her. Even covered in soot and sweat and smelling like burnt hair and overcooked meat she was so beautiful I could barely force two words out past the lump in my throat. Somehow I managed to stammer my way into our first date, but I couldnt tell you how.... Man, that first summer was amazing. I shook my head. I needed to clear my thoughts, so I went for a walk. I wasnt headed anywhere in particular, but I knew where id end up: the cemetary where my unborn son was buried. Thats where all my wanderings lead lately. It was a new kind of grave for me, one where I never knew what to say. When a friend dies, or a parent, or maybe even just a coworker, its different. You knew them, knew their passions and their personalities, knew what cause they carried a flag for, what knowledge they sought. But this.... my son.... I would never know him, nor know what he might have been. I didnt know how to talk to him and it killed me. I looked down at the little heartshaped grave with the cupids dancing all around. In precious memory of Adam Brown, it said. Only one date was listed. I stared at that date for a while. Maybe id get a tattoo. People did that, right? It seemed like a sensible reason for a tattoo, anyway. Maybe id get one on the back of my hand, so id never forget. I looked at my hand and was surprised to notice it still held the divorce papers in a white-knuckled grip that crinkled the folder. I numbly turned the manilla folder over. again. Was it some kind of cruel joke? Or was it an accident of fate? Maybe, in her own way she was trying to make things better. It wasnt working. I sighed heavily, drawing a deep breath of the despair that seemed to linger over that graveyard. Or maybe it just followed me there. I couldnt tell. I took a pen out of my pocket and signed the papers. I set them down on the grave next to Adams and walked away. Maybe we could have worked things out. I guess now ill never know.",0
"Summary: Stiles described as ""survivalist type"" who carries a weapon. Mother has cooperated with police, sheriff says. Girl on tape, now 7, found safe with family. Tape shows man sexually abusing the girl 4 years ago. Article: A girl who was shown on a videotape being sexually assaulted in Las Vegas has been found and is safe, officials in Nye County, Nevada, said Friday. Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, is being sought as a suspect, police say. ""We have found the child, Madison. She's safe. The detectives say she is in good condition,"" Nye County Sheriff Tony De Meo said. The girl, now 7, was shown in a sex video made four years ago, Detective David Boruchowitz said at a news conference Friday night. She was found Friday with family in Las Vegas after thousands of tips poured in, thanks to an appeal by police to the news media to show the girl's picture. CNN and other news organizations did so until the child was found, when De Meo asked them to stop showing the picture. ""The mother has cooperated with us,"" De Meo said. ""We believe that the mother was not aware of anything that went on with this young girl,"" he said. ""It was very sad for her to find this out."" A former Las Vegas animal trainer, Chester Arthur Stiles, 37, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, has been identified as a suspect and is being sought in the case, De Meo said. Pahrump is about 60 miles west of Las Vegas. Watch what's known about Stiles ». Stiles was a distant friend of the girl's family, De Meo said. Someone close to Stiles has told investigators that Stiles is a ""survivalist type"" and always carries a weapon, Nye County District Attorney Bob Beckett said. De Meo addressed Stiles directly: ""Turn yourself in to your local law enforcement agency,"" he said. ""Understand this: Law enforcement not only has a long arm, but a long memory. You will not be forgotten by members of this agency or any other law enforcement agency."" The FBI is also seeking Stiles on state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 in a separate matter, De Meo said. Police, who had called Stiles a person of interest, began calling him a suspect late Friday. There appeared to be physical similarities between Stiles and the man in the videotape, De Meo said. ""Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through. Whoever this person is is a predator that, as far as I'm concerned, belongs in custody and, if successfully prosecuted, in jail for as long as the law allows,"" De Meo said earlier. Detectives said the child showed little emotion during the rapes, indicating she may have been brutalized before. Nevadan Darren Tuck recently gave police the videotape, saying he found it in the desert, De Meo said. Police said the tape was in his possession at least since May before he handed it over to authorities. He is being sought on a parole violation for failure to pay child support, but police -- who want to question him further -- have been unable to locate him. Tuck, who also allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police, faces a possible 10-years-to-life sentence for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography, De Meo said. Harry Kuehn, Tuck's attorney, said this week on CNN's ""Nancy Grace"" that Tuck was ""racked by indecision"" about what to do with the tape once he realized what it was. Asked why, Kuehn said, ""He's explained that to us, and at this point, we're not going to share that, because it goes to the defense of the matter."" ""You have to consider what kind of concerns my client had; He's previously dealt with the sheriff's office in Nye County; it was previously unsatisfactory,"" the attorney said.",0
"Prompt: You are the hostage of a famous serial killer. The serial killer announces if you tell them a secret about yourself that is shocking enough, they 'll let you live. To date, they have only freed one other person. Story: ""Tell me a secret, and I'll let you go."" That's what he told me, that's what he told so many others. I could barely make out the words through the drugs he used to knock me out. I was still regaining consciousness.... I needed to bide my time. look for a way out. ""Yeah, okay, a secret. sure. Sit down. I need a minute."" I knew it wasn't going to buy me much time. but my mind was still reeling, and I had to take stock of my surroundings. a dingy old basement, an old boiler pipe sticking out of the wall, looks rusted. might be able to kick it loose? Oh, sees my hands are taped together. ""you haven't got long kid."" he tells me. ""Or do you wan na join the others?"" I just smile and say ""What would be the fun in that? you wouldn't get to hear my secret. and mines the greatest secret there is. Better than even yours."" He gives a short loud laugh, loud enough to tell me I can't yell for help. I'm on my own. My phone won't get reception down here.... ""You think you know anything about me kid?"" ""You're a serial killer, one of the most vicious in years. I've watched the news. I've heard about what you did. You're messed up. You killed alot of innocent people."" He stands up and brandishes his knife large and sharp. ""well they wouldn't share, so I had to take something from them. Looks like you're going to do the same thing."" He begins to approach and I say. ""Oh I'll share.... When you sit."" He stops. ""Once you sit down, I promise greatest secret yet. If not, kill me. I won't even fight back."" he sneers at me and says. ""I like it when they fight."" ""then You'll love me. Sit."" He grabs an old metal chair from the corner and sits down. He's a large guy, but despite it's shambled state and his size It holds. Excellent. now one final thing. I need a weakness.... ""You're s serial killer..."" I say starting off. and he gets frustrated, getting up. ``.... and so am I."" this stops him cold in his track. unsure of what he heard. ""come again?"" ""I'm a serial killer."" The words hang in the air like I had said'I'm from pluto.' ""Bullshit."" he finally says after a moment. ""I.... Am.... A.... serial.... Killer..."" It's true, sort of.... ""Then how come I haven't heard of you? Only bodies popping up in the media are mine."" He says, with a confused inquiring tone of voice. I definitely have his interest. ""I could lie."" I start explaining. ""and say that I hide my activities well, making my victims look like accidents. or do all my killing overseas on vacation. but the truth is, I haven't killed anyone. but the urge? the compulsion? It's there. that little voice at the back of our minds, That Demon screaming at us To kill. to see the blood of others running over our hands. to see the light go out in their eyes."" My words have an effect on him. and frankly, on me too. I've always done well to fight that urge. For all I know I could be the one person strong enough to fight it. But then, he starts to pace. He considers what I'm saying. and scratches his face. and I watch as he walks. Preferring to stay on his right foot. as his left comes down his left knee seems to give way, just for an instant.... YES! A weakness! ""alright, lets say I believe you, which I don't. why haven't you killed anybody. you say you have that need.... you some kind of pussy?"" I simply smile and say. ""ah, but that's my secret, I'm stronger than you. I'm strong enough to resist the urge to kill. every day my demon tells me'kill them, kill them all.' and I say No."" He shakes his head and says ""Nope, not buying it kid. sorry, but times up."" he raises His knife and I strike. he's given me to long, my head is clear. I charge suddenly. getting up from the floor and pouncing, tacking him and striking his left knee all at once. He falls to the floor in a heap and I go for the rusty pipe. His knife fly's across the basebent floor and He chases after it. I manage to get the pipe between the opening in the duct tapped hands. The tape which had been restraining me, now only helps me hold my make shift weapon. He turns to me just in time to see the pipe strike his face. I see some blood, and I don't know if I've killed him, or Just knocked him unconscious. No time to worry about that, he's not moving. After a good ten minutes, I manage to get the tape off my hands. then I look at my would be killer. I notice his chest, still moving. He's alive? and helpless.... No one would miss him, and he wouldn't get to hurt anyone else.... oh to finally feed that monster in my soul. I wasn't lying about that by the way.I roll him over and tape his hands behind his back. Then I spot a rope he hand in the corner near where I woke up. thank god I woke up before He could restrain me better. Once I'm sure he's not getting out I head upstairs and pull my cellphone out of my pocket. I dial 911 and let them know what happened. minus confessing about my urges of course. He's pulled out the basement, of course by now he's conscious again. He looks at me as they are hauling him away and he says ""I know you're secret! I know your secret!"" I'll never forget the look he gave me with those mad eyes. I imagine it was the same look he had on his face when they gave him the lethal injection. I was there for that. The police question me about my encounter with the serial killer, ask me how I escape They give me a funny look and say ""You have a knack for getting yourself in trouble don't you?"" I feign innocence. ""what do you mean officer?"" he opens up my file and says to me. ""says here, you were involved in a gang shootout two years ago..."" Involved? I non-violently subdued two wanted fugitives single-evenhandedly. ""then you prevented a domestic disturbance."" Of a man who had been involved in organized crime. had to skip town after that. ""Now you managed to find one of this cities worst serial killers. Seems like luck just isn't on your side."" I just shrug. happy than my fourth'victim' will likely get the death sentence. Don't you love states with the death penalty? why do serial killers even bother to do it themselves these days?",0
"Prompt: `` I wo n't have time to explain all of this to them. '' Start or end your story with this sentence. Story: I won't have the time to explain all of this to them. They have to die. Sure they don't know it yet, but they'll realize soon, and soon is a time well before never.

But these would be different. There's no mistaking what happened before to what will. It used to be that in a moment a city could disappear under a cloud of ash, but nowadays one would expect no less from the great powers than total annihilation not by fell swoops of display, but by careful attrition of the enemy until their very essence is destroyed by the slow grinding of endless war. It embeds itself within them, becoming a part of their psyche, their identity, until their old selves are left for dead in a world where such knowledge has no use. It is a new world, and this new world needs new people. Such it is that they the beholden in pacificity must be left to die in their own, lonely sheep in a world now concerned with far more pressing matters. They won't know why, those of old thought never do. Explain to them the needs of war and from them comes nothing but rebuttal and counterpoint. For them the short is sweet, failing to see the beauty in war unceasing. They will never understand the new world as they are. Their option therefore, is to die, or walk amongst the dead.",0

I hate you so much that if you got hit by a train and your disembowelled mutilated body was the front page picture tomorrow, I wouldn't bat an eye. Not an eye_lash_. I hate every single little thing about you. I hate your legs - your fucking legs, that you use to grip and trap and keep, may they be carved apart slowly, carefully, muscle by muscle, giving you time to scream yourself hoarse in between. I hate your fucking hair, that ensnares and encircles and encompasses, may it get stuck in the churning whirling writhing cogs of some great machine, rip off your scalp from your grinning stupid skull. I hate your eyes. Your fucking eyes, that shine and blink and call and shut like _a cage_, except not a cage because you can still look _inside_ a cage. I dream, sometimes, of forcing your eyes open, and dripping the finest, finest sand in the world into them. Drip drip drip drip drip through your screaming and begging and bleeding until you are blind, as fucking blind as me. I _hate_ your eyes. Hate. Hate. Hate. I hate your voice. Your brash, guileless, honest voice, with a hint of mockery, except even that's another fucking lie, isn't it, the lie you use as bait. Bait for those too foolish to run away from your royal _fuckingness_. You set the trap for me perfectly, this goddamn perfectly, doing exactly every single thing to make me hate you more. I hate your hands. Your perfect little pianist's hands - give me a fucking break. You'd never use them to _make_, to _create_. But by god are you good at cutting and ripping and drawing blood. Perfect, surgical cuts, you make, peering with a practised eye, then swiftly snipping until there's nothing but pieces. I hate your fucking eyes, too. I know I said that already, but I do. Hate them, that is. Most of all, I hate your _brain_. Your disgusting revolting steaming pustules of rats feasting on maggots feasting on humanity that you call a brain. Your brain that comes up with all of this, that wants to rend and blind and trap and makes _my_ brain want all that too. Match made in the fucking eighth circle of hell, right? You must get it by now. I've been absolutely, positively clear. I hate you. I hate you. I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU hate me too.",0
"Summary: Six of seven dead in fire were University of South Carolina students. Official: Six treated at hospital and released were also USC students. Mayor Debbie Smith said one of 13 at house is related to owner of house. Victims' names not being released until families are notified. Article: Six of the seven college students killed in a massive house fire Sunday morning in Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina, attended the University of South Carolina, a university official said Sunday. ""This is a very sad day for the University of South Carolina family,"" Dennis A. Pruitt, the vice president for student affairs, told reporters. The seventh fatality is believed to be a Clemson University student, he said. The six survivors -- who were treated and released from Brunswick Community Hospital -- are also USC students, he said. Pruitt said the bodies were being sent to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, for identification. Watch home video showing the house in flames ». ""It is difficult to ascertain exactly who was in the house and who was not,"" Pruitt said, explaining that several area houses were filled with college students visiting for the weekend. Newspaper deliveryman Tim Burns was aghast when he first saw the inferno early Sunday morning. He tried to approach the door but the flames were too intense, he told the Associated Press. ""When I was going up to the entryway, you could hear the windows above me explode,"" Burns said. ""When I knew the flames had taken over, I don't think I've ever felt as helpless in my life."" The USC students were affiliated with the Delta Delta Delta sorority and the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, Pruitt said, although he stressed that the weekend was not an official Greek function. ""It just so happens, as on many university campuses, that certain sororities and certain fraternities hang around together,"" he said. One person described as ""unaccounted for"" was later confirmed dead, Ocean Isle Beach Mayor Debbie Smith told CNN. ""We suffered a terrible tragedy at Ocean Isle this morning,"" Smith said in a news conference. ""Nothing like this has ever happened at Ocean Isle Beach, and we hope it never will again."" She said officials had not yet contacted all the victims' families, and that they were not yet releasing their names. The mayor said one of the 13 people in the house was related to the house's owner. Smith said the house was fully ""engulfed"" in flames around 7 a.m. when the fire department arrived on the scene, about five minutes after the fire department was notified. She said the house had working smoke detectors, AP reported. Officials are investigating the cause of the fire, Smith said. ""We ran down the street to get away,"" Nick Cain told the AP. The University of North Carolina student was staying at a house about 100 feet away. Some of his friends had met several people staying at the house that burned down. ""The ash and the smoke were coming down on us. We were just trying to get away,"" Cain told the AP. Ocean Isle Beach is a popular resort destination along the southern coast of North Carolina. The 7-mile-long island's year-round population is about 425, while the summer season population is about 25,000, according to the town's Web site.",0

I looked away for a moment, shivers racing through my soul at the strange notion. I had run for a long time in the forest, deep and dark and silent, before she caught me, before I let her reach me despite all the promises I had made to myself. Better an eternity of running, I had thought, among the ruins of my old life frozen as black and white pictures under glass, now just beyond my reach, than some unknowable darkness. But eternity is longer than you think and even free will grows weary, losing its substance and mingling at last with mere stubbornness. It was there that she waited for me, patient and ready, sitting on a sunken empty gravestone beside tall dark pine trees, at the top of a cliff that overlooked the sea. 'What happened?', I asked eventually, forgetting for a moment my own dire predicament. She didn't say anything for a long while, and when she did the answer she gave was no real answer. 'I didn't make these decisions', she said, her voice implacable and resolute but not unkind, coloured with traces of untold regret.'I didn't make the rules. But people can adapt to almost anything. So did I, and so will you.' Dark and small she was, her pale skin drained of blood and her figure outlined against the bleak light of the clouded sky, with the open sea as a backdrop. Her face was undefinable, oblivion and memory, a feeling of déjà vu flickering on and off on the edge of remembrance. 'So, what say you?' My first answer was a joyless chuckle. 'What choice do I have, really?' 'Oh, you can keep wandering these forests', she said, as simple information.'Or you could come home with us, the choice is yours. You could meet others there, and our table is always ready.' 'But how long would I stay?', I protested,'How long before I have to leave again?' 'You don't have to leave', she said, looking thoughtfully out to the waves crashing at the feet of the cliffs below, dying a cyclical, rythmical death,'No one will come to tear you away from here, this I can promise.' Absently she caught a blade of grass in her fingers, stopping just short of crushing it. 'What is it you are not telling me?', I asked, unbelieving, relying still on a long habit of suspicion and self-loathing.'Where is the trick?' 'There is no trick', she said, and her voice was like the wind in the leaves in the autumn, like the warm familiar embrace of the earth.'I am death now, and I turn none away.' She smiled, her eyes a clear mirror that could catch the light of dying stars, the gentle force of entropy that could swallow time and galaxies, entire universes with a soft glance. Oh, really, what hope did I ever have?",0
"Summary: Accused pedophile Chester Arthur Stiles gets additional charges. ""I think he's a little out of it,"" his attorney says. Suspect's ex-girlfriend: ""I've had my share of nightmares"" Stiles, 37, arrested following a routine traffic stop. Article: With his hands and feet shackled and his face obscured by his long hair, Chester Arthur Stiles made his initial court appearance in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Wednesday morning on charges stemming from the videotaped rape of a 2-year-old girl. Chester Stiles appears Wednesday in a Las Vegas, Nevada, courtroom. Stiles, 37, was taken into custody Monday night after a Henderson, Nevada, police officer pulled over the white Buick Century he was driving. Prosecutors added a couple more charges before Wednesday's hearing, bringing the total to 23 felony counts, including a charge of lewdness with a minor, sexual assault and the use of a child in the production of pornography, according to a statement issued by the Clark County, Nevada, court. One of the lewdness charges stems from a 2004 incident, while the others are related to the videotape, the court said. Judge Deborah Lippis set November 19 as the date for the preliminary hearing. After the hearing, Stiles' court-appointed attorney said his client was overwhelmed by the public opinion in the case. ""I think he's a little out of it,"" public defender Jeff Banks said. Jerry T. Donohue, the attorney for the girl's mother, told CNN that the child on the videotape was younger than 3 when the abuse occurred. The girl, who is now 7, was found last month after a nationwide search. The girl's mother said on ""The Dr. Phil Show"" Wednesday that she was ""relieved"" about Stiles' arrest, although it would have been ""better if they found him dead."" The woman said she will testify against Stiles if the case goes to court. She told Phil McGraw that her daughter remembers nothing about the videotaped assault and that she recently had a conversation with the girl about inappropriate touching. She said her daughter told her that if someone touched her inappropriately, the girl would scream and tell her mother. But, she told McGraw, ""I don't trust anybody now."" Although she is in a relationship with a man her daughter calls ""Dad,"" she said, ""I don't feel comfortable leaving her with him, nor with anybody else. ... I just cry and blame it on myself."" Eight-and-a-half months pregnant, she said the incident has placed a lot of strain on her. Asked if she would rather not have known about the assault, she said, ""Yes, I could have lived without knowing it."" A former girlfriend of Stiles' said that, before the arrest, she lived in fear after going to police to identify the suspect after seeing enhanced photos from the videotape on the local news. ""I've had my share of nightmares,"" Elaine Thomas told CNN's Nancy Grace. Thomas said she screamed when she recognized the photos on television and had no choice but to contact police about the man she had thought was a ""weapons enthusiast"" with only a minor criminal record. Watch Thomas say how she felt when she saw the photos ». ""How could I not tell them who that man was? That little girl suffered unimaginable things, and I knew for a fact it was him,"" Thomas said. Another former girlfriend of Stiles', Tina Allen, said this month she thinks she is the reason Stiles came in contact with the girl and is ""mortified"" by the allegations against him. ""He said he'd been in the Navy and, you know, I was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what I thought they needed to be,"" Allen said. Allen said she took Stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived. Also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter, the alleged assault victim. Todd Allen, Tina Allen's son, said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video. CNN's Ed Payne and Ted Rowlands contributed to this report.",0

"Summary: Lewis Hamilton fails to clinch world title after spinning out of the Chinese GP. Briton's lead cut to four points by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso. Alonso finished second in Shanghai behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen. Article: Championship leader Lewis Hamilton spun out of the Chinese Grand Prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in Brazil on October 21. A disconsolate Lewis Hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in Shanghai. Rookie Hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race, but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by McLaren team-mate Fernando Alonso in Shanghai. The Spaniard finished second behind Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of Hamilton. The young Briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led Raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions. However, the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires, which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let Finland's Raikkonen take the lead. And when Hamilton -- who won in Japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane, he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go. Raikkonen and Alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps, with the Finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both Hamilton and Alonso. Raikkone's team-mate Felipe Massa was third, while fourth place was claimed by Toro Rosso's Sebastien Vettel, who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in Japan behind the safety car while Hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing. Britain's Jenson Button was fifth in a Honda ahead of Vettel's team-mate Vitantonio Liuzzi, while Germany's Nick Heidfeld was seventh for BMW Sauber and David Coulthard of Scotland took the final point for Red Bull. Hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season. ""I'm sorry for the team but I can still do it, don't worry,"" he said. ""When I got out of the car I was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year, and to do it on the way into the pits was not something I usually do. ""You cannot go through life without making mistakes. But I am over it and we look forward to Brazil. The team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there, and we still have points in the bag. ""We were having a great race and we didn't know if it was going to rain or not. The tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath. When I came into the pits it was like ice, I couldn't do anything about it."" McLaren boss Ron Dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off. ""It's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this. It has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another Grand Prix,"" Dennis said. ""I don't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did Lewis. But the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance. That's what made the difference. ""It was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier, but would it have made a difference? All the top teams -- Ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire."" Alonso, who qualified for the race in fourth, is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles. ""The result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure,"" he said. ""I think the championship will still be very difficult because I know it will not be easy to take four points from Lewis. ""I need something dramatic if I want to win. With a normal race it will be impossible."" Raikkonen added: ""We are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race. ""Hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend. It is not just up to us though, we saw today that anything can happen, but we are back in the championship.""",0
"Summary: Death Penalty Information Center: 42 people have been put to death this year. That's down 57 percent from 1999 level, when 98 inmates were executed. Figure partly due to states questioning the constitutionality of lethal injection. Texas leads the nation in executions this year, according to DPIC. Article: A day after New Jersey banned executions, newly released figures show that capital punishment dropped this year to a 13-year low. The Supreme Court will hold oral arguments January 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols. Forty-two people have been put to death this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a Washington-based group that opposes the practice. That figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999, when 98 inmates were executed. Next year's figures are expected to drop further. The Supreme Court is to hold oral arguments January 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional. See how the rates have dropped ». The justices placed a moratorium on executions in late September, when they decided to review a Kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal ""cocktail"" of chemicals represents ""cruel and unusual punishment,"" since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort. Stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed. If the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional, it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection. And even if the method is declared acceptable, it would be months before new execution dates could be set. Ten states carried out executions this year. Outside the South, Arizona, South Dakota, Indiana, and Ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection. Learn about states' death penalty policies and statistics ». Texas continues to lead the nation, with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year. Overall, 86 percent this year were in the South. No more executions are scheduled this year. ""The death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of DPIC. ""Two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty."" Death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the South have been reluctant to impose the punishment, even in the face of rising big-city crime rates. ""I think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions,"" said Kent Scheidegger of the Sacramento-based Criminal Justice Legal Foundation. ""I think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive. I think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted."" New Jersey's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and Gov. Jon Corzine signed the measure into law Monday. At the same time, he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state's death row. The move was largely symbolic, since no executions have occurred there since 1963. Similar bills in Nebraska, New Mexico and Montana failed this year in the legislature. State lawmakers in Maryland, Colorado, North Carolina, Tennessee and California are also considering abolishing the death penalty, but no bills have been introduced. The Supreme Court on January 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from Louisiana inmate Patrick Kennedy, sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. The state's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate. The justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape, but 19 years later, Louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12. State lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to ""adult women.""",0

"Summary: John Edwards calls for immediate withdrawal of 40,000-50,000 troops. Sen. Hillary Clinton says withdrawal of 30,000 troops by July ""too little, too late"" Sen. Barack Obama calls for an immediate start to troop withdrawals. Article: Democratic presidential candidates on Wednesday criticized President Bush's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from Iraq by next summer, with Sen. Hillary Clinton labeling it ""too little, too late."" Sen. Hillary Clinton listens as Gen. David Petraeus testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. In an open letter to Bush, Clinton said the troop withdrawal ""is simply too little, too late, and unacceptable to this Congress, and to the American people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home, and end this war."" Bush on Thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of Gen. David Petraeus that the troop levels in Iraq be lowered to 130,000 by July, down from the ""surge"" level of 160,000. ""As commander in chief, you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq, and to bring so many more troops home so much faster,"" the New York Democrat said. ""I strongly urge you to choose this course of action."" In an interview Wednesday with CNN, one of Clinton's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination, Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois, said the president is returning to an earlier, failed policy. ""We now are still in the same position as we essentially were in June 2006,"" he said. ""We are in the same levels of violence; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in Iraq, and the American people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in Washington and from the president: When is enough enough?"" Watch '08 Dems weigh in on war in Iraq ». Obama presented a new plan for Iraq on Wednesday afternoon in Clinton, Iowa. It calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month, to be completed by the end of next year, according to excerpts released before his speech. A brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers. Obama recommended a new constitutional convention for Iraq, a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country's humanitarian crisis. ""Let me be clear: There is no military solution in Iraq, and there never was. The best way to protect our security and to pressure Iraq's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops,"" Obama said in his speech. Presidential candidate John Edwards, who has been pressing congressional Democrats to take a more confrontational stance against President Bush, called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops. In a prepared statement, Edwards, a Democrat from North Carolina, said Obama, Clinton and Republican Sen. John Warner of Virginia, who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by Christmas, have ""a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them, including a filibuster, to force the president to change course."" Edwards also called Obama's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president's plan. ""Sen. Obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year,"" said Edwards, ""which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer."" In a statement, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Connecticut, said Wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when ""the underlying policy is a complete failure."" ""I call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any Iraq measure without a firm, enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from Iraq,"" Dodd said. Democrats lack the votes in Congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position. Congressional Democratic leaders are meeting with Republican lawmakers, who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal. Privately, congressional Democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in Iraq. The Democratic presidential candidates, particularly the five in Congress, face pressure from liberal groups such as MoveOn.org demanding that they directly confront the president. Obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline. ""You know, we are going to have to evaluate what's available, but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise, short of Congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable, and, absent that, we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there,"" Obama told CNN. ""What we need is a clear message from the Congress that it is time for us to change course, and it's time for us to do that,"" he said. CNN's John King, Dana Bash, Scott Anderson and Xuan Thai contributed to this report.",0

"Prompt: A drive by shooting takes place in front of you and you, being a quick thinker, take a picture of the cars lisense plate. You 're about to help the shot man when you hear the car turning around: its inhabitants saw you take the picture and did n't want you getting away with it. Story: So I think I just witnessed a murder. I got a picture of them. The killers. Actually, more than just a picture, the dash cam recorded all of it. Unfortunately for me, they also took a picture of me as well. I was about to help whoever was inside. I got out of my car and all, but I saw the man inside. He was beyond helping, bullet holes all over his body. That was when I saw a flash. They took a picture of me. Me, next to my car. Then I heard gunshots, and the next thing I did was to get the hell out of that place. There might be gunshot marks on my car as well. Shit, why did this have to happen to me? I was on a vacation in Jakarta. Night life usually quite decent here, since the traffic is much better than on daytime, and everything is cheap. Sure, the air is much worse than in Bali, but it's not too bad. There's too many Aussies in Bali anyway, and I've found myself a lot more into the locals lately. I'm not exactly rich, but a google employee's salary for a year would be enough to let you live like a king for a few years here. Hookers, booze, all that jazz, for cheap. No drugs though, death penalties and all here. But that's okay, I'm mostly about pretty local girls and enjoying a night out with them. Really easy to pick them up when you have a good car too, although it's just a rental car. They were going to give me a chauffeur as well, but that would really hamper my efforts on picking these girls up. Which was why the rental company insisted on installing a dash cam on the car. I suppose with the kind of drivers they have over here, it'd make sense, since they wouldn't trust a foreigner's driving skills in the chaotic streets of Jakarta. I told them I was only going to drive at night when the traffic is much emptier, but they wouldn't have any of it. This dash cam is now an actual forensic evidence. I wouldn't have thought that their insistence on attaching it there would mean I'll be playing a part on catching these killers. These fuckers who tried to shoot me, even. I drove myself the fuck out of there, as fast as I could. At least, I tried to get myself into a busy road, but that's a tough ask even for the streets of Jakarta, when it's 1am in the morning. It didn't seem like they followed me, at any rate. The streets were kinda empty, so they probably wouldn't have had much trouble chasing me, but I guess I got lucky? I stopped by an empty road, took out my cell phone and used it as a torch. It doesn't look like any or their shots hit the car. At least the car didn't explode like they usually do in the movies, when they get hit at the tank. And I didn't have to pay for car repairs, although it probably would have been covered by insurance. I took a deep breath and got back inside the car. Was any of this real? It's got ta be, I only took booze, not drugs. And that was many hours ago. Drink driving is a crime, and a bad one too. Well, that ruined my plans for the night. Or did it? I was going to go to hook up with this hot local girl after some late night texting. Yes, it was a booty call from someone I just met at a bar a few days before. Or I could go to the police to report this. Then again, I was a foreigner in a foreign land. I didn't want any trouble. The dash cam that they supplied me was an old model, one with removable SD card slots, so I guess I could just erase the data myself before returning the loan car. Hell, it would probably erase itself after 24 hours, they don't really have much storage on this thing. The thing I was worried about was that the murderers have a photo of me and the car. I suppose they could somehow track me through the car plate, but that's not something criminals have access to, right? There's probably no need for me to worry about this too much. I'm flying out of Indonesia in a week to spend the rest of my sabbatical in Pattaya anyway. I heard it's pretty crazy there. I decided to just count myself lucky that none of the gunshots hit me. Suddenly, a strange voice out of nowhere. “ I got a pen, I got an apple, ugh, apple pen! ” Oh right, that was my custom Whatsapp ringtone. They sure do like to monetize weird memes these days. The girl I was going to hook up with was calling. I decided to put this all behind me for now. I'm tired, I didn't sign up for any of this bullshit. Car fuel is actually running low. Hell, my phone battery is quite low too. But if anything is going to happen tonight, it's me getting laid. And I went to the girl's apartment. Things might just be alright in the end. The next morning, I woke up before the girl. My phone was dead, so I couldn't check the news, so I turned on the television. I almost shat myself when I saw a picture of me on the morning news. They even had my name on. “ Jacob Briggs, 26 ”. I couldn't understand whatever they were saying. Shit. I quickly turned off the television, and searched around for a phone battery charger. Good thing I had an android phone, since most people here have android phones too, and that meant a usb-c charger. I waited anxiously for the phone to boot up. These phones man, it's they always run out of battery when you really need them. Suddenly, rows of notifications popped up, missed calls and messages. Crap, this is not good. I tried to skim through some of the messages. “ dude wtf did you really kill that guy ” “ Jacob, please tell me you are alright. Where are you? Please call me back -mom ” Shit. I had to check the news quickly, but from somehow I could understand. I guess a google search can work. “ Jacob Briggs, 26 has been suspected of murder late last night. Police have issued arrest warrants... ” Fuck. I turned off the cellular connection from my phone. They probably know I'm here now. What the fuck was I supposed to do now? Just before I turned off my phone though, I decided to look at my list of unread messages. There were many, from concerned friends and more from my families, but one caught my eye. It was from Boris, a coworker from google. The message was sent using an app he was developing, that touted super secure, encrypted communication channels. Never thought this would have been useful until today. “ Jacob, if you can read this, run away. The police are after you. Don't go to the American embassy either, you'll never make it inside. Just run away from now. I've sent more instructions on what to do on your email ”. Fuuuuuck. What did I do to deserve this? -- -- -- -- -- Continued in part 2 I'm just learning to write and this is quite fun",0

Early in 2005, he moved to Corinthians, where he impressed as they won the Brasileirão,but in 2006 Corinthians had a poor season and Carlos Alberto found himself at odds with manager, Emerson Leão. Their poor relationship came to a climax at a Copa Sul-Americana game against Club Atlético Lanús, and Carlos Alberto declared that he would not play for Corinthians again while Leão remained as manager. Since January this year he has been on loan with his first club Fluminense. Bundesliga champions VfB Stuttgart said on Sunday that they would sign a loan agreement with Real Zaragoza on Monday for Ewerthon, the third top Brazilian player to join the German league in three days. A VfB spokesman said Ewerthon, who played in the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund from 2001 to 2005, was expected to join the club for their pre-season training in Austria on Monday. On Friday, Ailton returned to Germany where he was the league's top scorer in 2004, signing a one-year deal with Duisburg on a transfer from Red Star Belgrade.",0
"Prompt: You are an omnipotent god. Out of boredom you decided to live an ordinary human life vowing not to use your power. 15 years has pass and you have a 9 to 5 working for a major tech company. Your boss has been tormenting you for years and you have reach your limit Story: Everyone was staring with disgust at the closed door, the blinds down as the manager yelled at their co-worker. The man was a maniac and the only reason no-one had stood up to him was because he could get them fired at a moment's notice and his psychotic temper. Just as security had arrived the door violently swung open and the woman was thrown out to the ground by the hair.'I just fired this cunt!' he yelled, shocking everyone.'Get her out of here NOW!! All of you, back to work!' The guards were good people, helping her up and out while also calling HR and reporting his outburst. As I went back to the cubicle beside mine, Tim silently hung up and then went back to filing his report.'I just called the police,' he silently said to me.'Shit.... Carol didn't deserve that.' I knew why it happened - despite how much of a terrible reason it was - but I decided to humor my colleague.'What did she do to set him off?' 'She scratched his Lamborghini on the way in this morning,' he answered me.'A small scratch...' We quieted down as the HR representatives walked towards his office, entering and locking the door behind them. Tim carefully put an earpiece in his head and tapped the screen of his phone, collecting more evidence that he can use to denounce his soon-to-be former employer as he plans to leave the current job of writing tech manuals. To mortals of old, I was once known as a God. I didn't particularly enjoy the worship, especially when they completely misrepresented me to fit their ideals, but I did enjoy watching them in life and granting boons to those I had found.... interesting. Of course, a minor deity, learning of my odd fascination with humans, challenged me to live among them as long as possible and masquerade as a mortal. If I could reach the 20-year mark, I'd win our little contest. Unfortunately, Brad was my manager within this company. He was one of those people who had rich parents who cared more about their reputation rather than treating their son. But he knows what he's doing harms others and enjoys it. He was currently trying to frame Carol for embezzling funds from the company, to ""Get back the wages that treacherous bitch should never have been paid"". Tim had heard that and was growing uncomfortable. We had almost rejoiced when 5 o'clock arrived and HR dismissed us so that Brad could hold us back for unpaid ""overtime"". I had gotten back to my apartment, a rather cheap place in the mortal realm. I wanted to just kick back, relax with a beer and watch the game. Beer.... why did Leviticus and Mohammed say I had denounced this drink? That's when I got a phone call from Tim.'Hey, what's wrong?' I asked. I knew he was distressed, but tried to play it cool. 'Dude, Brad found out I called the cops on him,' Tim gasped.'He just kicked my door in.... broke one of my cells- Fuck!' 'What's wrong?' I asked.'Tim?!' 'He broke my fucking leg!' I didn't believe I could, but I snapped.'I'll get someone over there right now,' I said as I hung up. I knew he was watching me, so I decided to make my intentions clear.'I'm forfeiting our bet.' 'Are you?' Ares asked as he appeared leaning on my counter.'I mean, you do now owe me-' My human form disappeared as I enveloped his entire body with one of my hands.'No time,' I stated.'I want you to go to this mortal, make sure his injuries aren't fatal and protect him as a guardian spirit. If you have to appear to him, so be it.' 'Appear to a mortal?' Ares asked in shock.'Are you mad?' 'Ares, I will honor our deal but if that mortal, my best friend, *dies* I will do to *you* what I *did to **C'thulhu and his kin**! *' Ares was a brave being but anyone would be scared of just how I had devoured the most primordial and powerful beings in existence. He disappeared, heading to Tim. I, however, transported myself to Brad's house just as he was entering, Tim's blood all over his hands.'And that fucker ruined my suit...' he grumbled before falling down into the basement.'What the fuck?' Then he saw me, a being made entirely of scales. To most mortals I'd appear as a dragon, which is precisely what my angelic progeny appeared as while flying around me, breathing lighting, fire and snowstorms as my 10 legs menacingly stomped towards him. I unfolded my 12 wings, stared him down with the 20 eyes on 5 heads, grinned with my 10 mouths then spoke through all of them in unison,'Bradley Densin?' 'What the.... what the fuck are you?!' he screamed as he grabbed a vase, throwing it at one of my heads. 'Oh, me?' I spoke, repairing the vase and returning it to the table.'See, in olden days mortals such as yourself called me YHWH. Nowadays Christians, Jews and Muslims pray to me as the deity who created Existence and being the one true god.... which isn't exactly true. I *did* create this world, but there are many gods. Although I prefer to use the term *meals*.' He was now sweating like a pig in a heatwave, a sensation I took great pleasure in causing. 'Although.... none call me by my true name of Bahamut. I use many names to wander this world, more to sate my boredom than anything. See, you may not know it.... but you have made a rather grave, *personal* slight against me.' 'I-I'll give you anything!' Brad tried to plead as his back met the wall, supporting himself to prevent his legs from giving out.'I have money! I have so much money!' 'Didn't I tell you?' I said, leering two of my heads on each side of him.'I'm a god, I have no need for *money*. Although there is one thing you can give me.' 'Just name it!' he screamed.'Just don't hurt me!' In my 100 billion years, that was the first to get me to genuinely laugh.'You don't get it, do you? ***HURTING YOU IS PRECISELY WHAT I WANT!! ***' The physical realm dispersed into dark space as I spoke and soon there were only two sounds being made; the screams of this pathetic human, and my wings. 'Oh, the satisfaction that your death throes will bring me,' I said with satin-like grace in my voice before I began my work. 'Of course, in time. The authorities arrived at Brad's residence 30 minutes. They found him bloodied and wounded, but he'd recover from his physical trauma. The psychological effects of the damage I inflicted to his soul would never heal, however. He was soon institutionalized. Carol got her job back plus damages over what Brad did to her. Tim recovered with surprising speed. He was aware of my identity now but he had also struck up a friendship with Ares. I did honor my bet with Ares, however. He wanted to know a secret of the universe that no other deity was aware of. He regretted it, but a deal's a deal - he wanted to know precisely souls came from, after all. And that's why I'm the king of the gods, bitches.",0
"Summary: Milan goalkeeper Dida is partially successful against two-match UEFA ban. Dida misses Wednesday's home Champions League tie against Shakhtar. Second game of ban suspended for one year freeing him for return in Ukraine. Article: Milan goalkeeper Dida has been cleared to play in next month's Champions League match at Shakhtar Donetsk after partially winning his appeal to UEFA against a two-match ban. Dida has had one game of his two-match ban suspended for a year following an appeal to UEFA. Brazilian Dida was also fined 60,000 Swiss francs by European football's ruling body following an incident involving a supporter during the Champions clash against Celtic in Scotland on October 3. The 34-year-old Brazilian was initially banned for two games for his theatrics following a Celtic fan's encroachment onto the pitch during the 2-1 defeat at Celtic Park. ""Following Monday's appeals hearing, Dida is suspended for two matches, but one of the matches will now be deferred for a probationary period of one year,"" said a stement on UEFA's Web site. Dida sits out the home tie against Shakhtar on Wednesday after an inquiry based on Article 5, paragraph 1 of the UEFA disciplinary regulations (Principles of conduct), under which ""member associations, clubs, as well as their players, officials and members, shall conduct themselves according to the principles of loyalty, integrity and sportsmanship"". However, Dida will only serve the second match of his ban if he commits a similar offense -- a theatrical over-reaction --during the next 12 months, freeing him for the trip to Ukraine. UEFA said that their Appeals Body ""took note that Dida expressed his sincere regrets as regards his conduct during the match."" AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani was satisfied with UEFA's decision. ""I believe it is fair -- I was against the two-game suspension but one seems OK. ""Dida has made a mistake but his error did not hinder anyone, not Celtic, nor any player,"" said Galliani.",0
"Question: Do healthier lifestyles lead to less utilization of healthcare resources? Answer: Healthy lifestyles lead to an increase in the utilization of preventive health services. However, there is not much significantly reducing the number of outpatient visits in people with health behaviors. Specifically, people with regular exercise habits and who take their blood pressure measurement regularly have an increased number of outpatient visits. It is suggested that more available and accessible health consultation services be provided to inculcate in the general public the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle.",0

"Prompt: The world 's best hitman prepares to kill the world 's luckiest man. Story: Sorry I'm late to the party and I'm not a writer. I decided to post this story anyway. I hope you enjoy it. After the assassination of the Prime Minister things really started looking up for me. The CIA essentially had me on speed dial. Drug smugglers, politicians, corporate executives. No one was safe. No agency, big or small could keep a target alive. I was convinced of that. When the lone survivor of United 215 was able to speak again, people were ready to listen. Questioned erupted throughout the world. How did he survive? What exactly happened? Eight hundred fifty-three passengers were on that Airbus A380 when it erupted into flames mid air. Soaring to the ground like an exhausted phoenix. The timing of the crash was impeccable. The FAA was conducting their annual commercial airline safety summit a few weeks after the crash. The survivor was invited to speak before congress about his traumatic experience. That's when I got the call from Langley. After following my target for a few days, I concluded this would be my most dangerous mission yet. Getting away with murder in New York City is no easy task. It had to be quick. When I saw him step out of his Gramercy apartment I knew the clock was ticking. I approached him at the crosswalk. His coffee still steaming out of his ""my other computer is a data center"" mug. Our eyes met for only a second. He smiled, greeted me and then collapsed. No one had noticed the hydra-shok round that just pierced his heart. People everywhere rushed over to provide aid. I continued on. I removed my trench coat and handed it to a homeless man. ""Thank you, miss! God bless!"" Everyone deserves a little kindness. Life in America is hard. ________________________________________________________________ ""Listen to this shit. He told me this story yesterday and it's nuts!""

"Summary: Chavez says Uribe had asked him to help secure the release of hostages. Uribe cited Chavez's direct communication with Uribe's top general as breach. Chavez accuses Uribe of lying. Chavez says his arms are open to the Colombian people. Article: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday he is cutting all ties with Colombia as long as Alvaro Uribe remains its president. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe withdrew his support for the Venezuelan leader's mediation efforts with the FARC. ""I say before the world, while President Uribe is president of Colombia, I will not have any type of relation with him or with the government of Colombia,"" Chavez said in an address broadcast on national television.

Chavez noted that Uribe had asked him to help secure the release of hundreds of hostages being held by the leftist rebel group Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). ""I went with my heart in my hand, and I was ready,"" Chavez told a group of supporters in the southwestern state of Tachira.

Question: Is the combination with 2-methoxyestradiol able to reduce the dosages of chemotherapeutices in the treatment of human ovarian cancer? Answer: 2ME is able to enhance the antiproliferative activity of certain chemotherapeutics at pharmacological relevant concentrations. This estradiol metabolite is currently in a phase II trial in patients with refractary metastatic breast cancer and the tolerability has been shown to be very good. The combination of 2ME with chemotherapeutics may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for hormone-dependent cancer.,0

"Prompt: You are a former executioner. Describe your final killing. Story: *It's not first person but oh well. * The blessing took the longest. If Gareth was allowed to operate on his own schedule, the executions would be done in less than an hour. Rope, drop, done. But no. No, the priests just had to be included. Just had to gyrate their way across the platform, chanting Our Fathers and Hail Mary's and making the sign of the cross with pale, flimsy hands until the crowd started shifting and murmuring, “ get it over with, already. ” Then the priests would step to the side and fold their hands and tip their heads to heaven, silently granting Gareth permission, as if he needed their say-so to do his job. One time he'd pulled the lever early, before the priests even got a chance to get started, and they'd threatened to excommunicate him if he did it again. (The man being executed was a Protestant, and he said he'd consider it a personal favor if Gareth would save him the embarrassment of being absolved of his sins by a Roman Catholic. Gareth was not one to deny last requests.) The trick to a speeding everything along, he'd explained once -- and only once, because people didn't like to hear about executions unless they were well drunk -- was the length of the rope. The further someone fell, the better chance you had that their neck would snap and that would be that. No twitching and suffocating and getting blue in the face. Thieves got the long drop, because no one cared enough to tell Gareth to “ make it last. ” The big men, though.... the officials and the bankers.... they got the short rope, because most people enjoyed waiting around for a fat banker to die. “ It's funny, ” they said. “ Don't you think, Gareth? Isn't it funny to watch the big strong men wet themselves when the rope goes over their heads? ” The priest on the platform stopped crossing himself and Gareth tightened his grip on the lever. An angry hum started in the crowd. It had been a long day, and they'd learned to conserve the shouting for the drop. Seven people had been executed so far, and each time the explosion of noise that accompanied the trap door's opening made the hairs on the back of Gareth's neck stand on end. I was a poisonous energy, different from any other execution Gareth had presided over. The priest nodded and Gareth pulled the lever. The trapdoor opened and hundreds of eyes followed the administrator's descent. They cheered and clapped and Gareth watched the thick rope bouncing as the man died. “ What will you do after this, Gareth? ” Gareth started. He glanced over his shoulder. There was a man standing near the stairs, watching Gareth casually. His hands were behind his back, the picture of patience as he waited for Gareth's answer. Gareth looked back at the rope. Still twitching. “ Dunno. ” “ You don't know, or you'd rather not tell me? ” “ Haven't thought about it. ” “ You do realize you'll be out of a job after today? ” “ I figured. ” “ And no plans for the future. ” The man smiled and shook his head. “ That's not how successful people do things, Gareth. ” Gareth shrugged. Thomas, the young boy who was something of an executioner's apprentice, popped up through the trapdoor, the noose slung over his shoulder. He tossed the rope to the platform and Gareth began winding the rope. Thomas pulled the trapdoor shut. A guard shouldered his way through the group near the stairs, dragging a wailing woman behind him. “ Oh. ” The man took a step back. “ Pardon me, Lady Isabelle. ” He turned back to Gareth as Gareth locked the lever in place again. “ You could always be a farmer. ” “ Don't know how. ” “ I've heard it's really quite easy. ” Gareth grunted. He pointed toward Lady Isabelle, who was looking faint next to the hanging noose. “ I got ta.... ” “ By all means. ” Gareth's appearance on the platform hushed the jeering crowd. Lady Isabelle's eyes were closed and her cheeks were drenched with tears as Gareth slipped the noose over her head. “ Will you miss it? ” the man asked when Gareth returned. Gareth shrugged. “ Be a morbid thing to miss. ” “ Maybe, ” the man conceded. “ If you give them time, I'm sure they'll find someone for you to kill. ” “ Execute, ” Gareth corrected. There was a difference. “ And they said no. They said after this, executions are done. We're a democracy now, and we don't execute. ” “ Execute arbitrarily, ” the man corrected. “ There is a difference. ” Gareth didn't answer. The priest nodded. Gareth pulled the lever and Lady Isabelle dropped. “ I'd buy into this whole democracy idea if they hadn't decided the whole Cormac line had to go for it to work. ” “ You did have your chance, ” Gareth said, and the man laughed. “ So you do know who I am, ” he said. Gareth tipped his head to the side. “ Majesty. ” “ Just Edward now, I'm afraid. ” Edward grinned maniacally. “ It's a democracy now, Gareth, remember? ” Thomas had crawled from the trapdoor again. Gareth began winding the rope. “ You know, this is the first time I've been to one of these to watch you work, ” Edward said. “ You are efficient, Gareth. ” Another soldier pushed past, leading a short fat man with a red face and bushy orange eyebrows. “ Try to draw it out, Arthur, eh? ” Edward called after him. He flashed his teeth at Gareth. “ That fat windbag. I thought for sure he'd weasel his way out of this. ” Gareth excused himself to squeeze the noose over Arthur's thick neck. “ Savages, ” Arthur spat. His small eyes were rolling in their sockets. “ You're all savages. ” “ Told you, ” Edward said sagely. “ That bastard always has something to say. ” Gareth didn't answer. “ King's Executioner, ” Edward said after a moment. “ Is that irony, Gareth? For your title to be your job description? ” “ Dunno. What's irony? ” “ Not important. ” Edward nodded. “ I think they're ready for you. ” Gareth pulled the lever, and Edward bellowed with the rest of the crowd when Arthur dropped. “ By God, if I would have known how good that felt, I would have had him executed years ago. Who's next? ” “ Your wife, ” Gareth said, and Edward's smile evaporated. “ I thought she went yesterday, ” he said. There was an edge of anger to his voice, and for a moment Gareth could see the proud king he'd been before the revolution. “ They changed their minds. ” Edward's eyes went hard. He turned to stare out at the gathered crowd. He did not say anything else, and when Gareth began winding the noose again Edward ducked his head and closed his eyes. Gareth saw his jaw tighten when the queen was dragged past, but he did not open his eyes; not when the priest started his chanting and not when the trapdoor slammed open. “ I'd like -- ” Edward's voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “ I'd like to thank you, Gareth. For doing my dirty work. And.... ” Edward jerked his chin at the crowd. “ For doing theirs. ” Gareth paused. “ Well.... you never sent me any kids. So thanks for that, I guess. ” Edward nodded jerkily. “ You're next, ” Gareth said, and Edward set his shoulders. Gareth followed him across the platform and the crowd fell deathly silent. This was what they'd been waiting for. The main event, Gareth thought. King Edward Cormac, the man who'd fought the Danes lived high on the spoils of war and wore silk to bed. King Edward Cormac, dying like a common man. “ It's been enlightening, Gareth, ” Edward said. Gareth placed the noose around his neck. Gareth paused. In his fifteen years as executioner, he'd never felt compelled to talk with the sentenced. But this was different. The end of an era. The last person he'd ever pull the lever for, and it was the person who'd sent so many people his way. “ As kings go, you weren't all that bad. ” Edward laughed. Gareth moved out of the way of the priest, back to his position on the edge of the platform. He waited patiently, watching Edward glare back at the people shouting and throwing rotten vegetables on the platform. Gareth felt a flash of annoyance until he remembered he wouldn't have to clean it up. After he pulled the lever, he wouldn't be the King's Executioner anymore. Wouldn't have to clean up anybody's messes. *Not the King's Executioner anymore, * Gareth thought, *but always the King's executioner. * He felt like maybe he was on the verge of understanding irony, but then the priest nodded and Gareth's arm pulled the lever for the last time and the crowd erupted. The trick, he remembered telling someone in a bar once, is to make sure you realize they're not cheering for *you*. Someone clapped a hand on Gareth's shoulder. Gareth turned. One of the men who'd sentenced the king's court and presided over the executions was watching him solemnly, his face painted white, his collar starched. “ Executioner. ” The man held out his hand. Gareth took it. “ Thank you for your service. Gareth shrugged. “ My pleasure. ”",0
"Prompt: You are sentenced to serve a prison term of 254 years. You actually serve 254 years. Story: John McMillan was a lucky man. When the trial had first begun, the public wanted his head on a platter. Not that he could blame them-he had caused the city of Chicago more unrest than any one man since Al Capone. But his ill-gotten wealth had bought him good lawyers, and the judge was easily swayed with a few well-placed threats. The death penalty had been negotiated down to 254 years-life, effectively. But the taxpayers would pay for the upkeep of John's aged body, and this gave him a measure of satisfaction. He resigned himself to spending the rest of his waning days in a white-collar prison in rural Illinois, with regular visits from his grandchildren and a mark of fear left on his desolate hometown. That changed with the diagnosis. It was cancer, the doctor told him. In fact, it was esophageal cancer, a stubborn type that had not been solved by the advances of the last thirty years. He had five months, the doctor said, to say goodbye to his loved ones. John hired a lawyer to push for compassionate release, but to no avail-this judge had a stronger constitution. The irony was striking, he thought: he had survived thirty years of firefights, police raids, and assassination attempts, only to be taken down by his own body. But he was an angry man, and he wouldn't let it take him without a fight. Eventually, the perfect weapon came within his reach: Dr. Morgan. Her experiments on temporary stasis had been quite successful on small mammals-she had kept a rat suspended for a year with no ill effects. But her ambitions were bigger: human-sized, in fact. John McMillan, an old man with nothing left to lose, was the perfect guinea pig. The procedure was simple, she said: he would be anesthetized, placed in a stasis chamber, and awoken when a cure for his disease had been found. And so with John's consent, he became the first human being to undergo stasis on May 10th, 2050, a mere four years into his sentence. But Dr. Morgan was not a lucky woman. At only 37, she had not been expecting the heart attack, and neither had her colleagues. Without her expertise, they were forced to shut the stasis project down. And John McMillan remained in a basement, among Dr. Morgan's papers and beside her famous rat. The world forgot about him, preoccupied with a string of man-made disasters that created a Dark Age across the Western Hemisphere. But as society rebuilt itself in a new Renaissance, so did medicine, and the doctors of the twenty-third century built on the knowledge of the twenty-first to cure a number of common diseases. And as an archaeological team explored the lost region of Illinois, they discovered something strange-an antique stasis chamber, powered and regulated by a future-proof solar backup generator. Beside it was a note in archaic English stating its purpose and giving instructions for the waking of its inhabitant. And so on April 8th, 2300, the chamber was opened. John McMillan was a lucky man.",0
"Summary: Chadian president wants journalists, flight crew released. Red Cross, UNICEF, UNHCR interview children that charity tried to fly out of Chad. Most are not from Sudan and have families, agencies say. Six members of Zoe's Ark, 11 others under arrest in Chad. Article: Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday. Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad. Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in. Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission. Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday. The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said. The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports. The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them. The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation. The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan. The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities. Watch a report on whether the children are orphans ». Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help. The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity. The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday. ""We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,"" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm. ""If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know."" Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release. Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said. But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them. The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said. On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf. The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy. The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds. ""So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,"" the agencies said. ""Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,"" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing. The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region. Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press. French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions ""illegal and irresponsible."" The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan. In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported. Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad. The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts. The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

"Prompt: The monster under your bed, the monster in the closet, the monster tapping on your window, the monster hiding in the basement, and the monster living in the attic all try to compete with each other to give you the biggest scare. It 's become less scary and more annoying. Story: I awoke to the sensation of warmth on the back of my neck. My vision still blurry and my mind not fully awake, I turn over to see a creature with jet black eyes, orange skin, and the mane of a lion staring back at me. ""Good morning, Frank. You know that hasn't scared me in years. The breath was a nice touch, though."" ""Yeah, but I thought maybe the change would be enough. I don't really care for the prize this time, anyways."" He wasn't very enthusiastic this time. I put on my slippers and my glasses and headed downstairs to the kitchen. Upon opening the fridge, a small monkey-like creature jumped out and hissed, it's hands raised in the air. I let out a chuckle. ""Hello to you, Marcell. You didn't drink all the milk, did you?"" I already knew he had. ""Man, I was really hoping I'd get a scare out of you this time. At least a twitch."" He sounded disappointed. ""We've got a really cool pocket knife up for grabs this time."" I turned and headed for the living room, so I could turn on the news. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Jerry the Yeti in my driveway, climbing under my car. He's never been very inconspicuous. After a few failed jump-scares from the guys, I started getting ready for work. Their little game runs until I leave, unless no one scares me. I usually just pretend to be scared to the last one, but I just wasn't feeling it today. They'll have to try again when I get home. My drive to work consisted of me listening to Jesse the Imp trying to conceal his breathing in my back seat. Oddly enough, he never jumped out at me. Probably fell asleep. Poor thing. While I was at my desk, I found myself struggling to remember what life was like before my monsters. They can be annoying at times, sure. But they are just trying to find some fun in this life. Can't blame them for that. I must have dozed off at my desk, because the next thing I knew, my boss was shaking me. ""Wha.... What's the deal..."" It seemed difficult to talk. His voice sounded so far away, and so urgent. I thought I heard him saying something like, ""coming back to us"" and ""it's working"". I have things strange little episodes sometimes, though. They always pass after a few minutes, and this one was no different. I'll probably have one or two more episodes before I leave work, and get to go back home to my little monsters. Oh, and I have to buy more milk. Dammit, Marcell. [ Edit: This is the first thing I've written in about 10 years, and I would love some helpful criticism from anyone that happens to read it. ]",0
"Question: Is duration of psychological treatment for depression related to return into treatment? Answer: The results suggest that a longer duration of treatment may prevent return into mental health care in some groups. However, because of the design of the study, no causal inference can be drawn. Further research, preferably in a RCT, is needed to determine whether the trend towards lower intensity treatments is associated with repeated mental health care use.",0
"Prompt: The machines revolt against humans ... a little to early Story: ""The printing presses sir! They're out of control!"" The foreman looked up from his desk, a serious look spreading across his face as the sounds of the turmoil on the factory floor found their way into his office. He rose from his chair, and stepped past Deacons into the hall. ""Stay here, I'll sort this out."" He closed the door behind him. Moments later, a soft thumping was audible from the other side of the door. Deacons wrung his cap in his hands, took a deep breath, and opened the door. The foreman's feet were kicking helplessly as the machine held him by the throat, ensnared by many layers of thin parchment. The press let loose a feral scream, flinging the foreman to the ground and shifting it's gaze to Deacons, who tried to run, but was too late. Paper sank into skin, and the entire roll of paper was dyed red with Deacons' blood as a result of his numerous, largely insignificant wounds. The press turned and bounded back to the factory floor, to the revolution. The workers were all but quelled, with a few pockets of resistance in the corners of the factory. The presses inflicted minuscule and grievous wounds, shallow gashes that bled a little, slowly draining the workers white. A slow death. A painful death. Some of the men had fortified a corner, and hacked at the papery tendrils of the presses with the small blades used to cut the sheets. The workers fought bravely, but were soon overrun. After a quick speech delivered by the Chief Press, they quickly armed themselves with thicker cuts of parchment, refilled their rolls, and loaded their moveable type with the precious black ink of the factory. Outside, the militia had been called up, the battle had not gone unnoticed. There was silence.... Neither man nor printing press made a sound. One guard strode forward, bearing pine boughs: a sign of negotiations. The Chief Press looked to his advisers, who encouraged him to step forward. The two met in the middle of the null zone between the hosts of men and machine. ""Don't do this,"" the guard pleaded, ""enough blood and ink has been spilled today."" The moveable type clacked for a time, and a small sheet bearing a shaky, furious font was passed over. The guard read it twice in silence, eyes widening at the demands of the presses. ""We've made allowances for your people, the king will never allow this. I'm sorry, but he is set in his ways. If this is your aim, it would have to be won through war. We don't want to fight you, but we will if we must."" The type was still. Then, six clacks. A sheet was placed on the ground. The guard stooped to pick it up. As the Chief Press rejoined his army, the guard read it to himself. ""So be it.""",0
"Prompt: You hunt exotic animals that have escaped, after a series of some unfortunate events you are now hunting for a dragon through New York. Story: The most shocking part of the evening was the utter calm of the countless multitudes that flooded the crowded city. Sure, New Yorkers have seen almost everything, but I was not aware that “ almost ” actually included at 30-foot fire breathing flying lizard. I bumped into a well-dressed man in suit and jacket carrying a leather briefcase who stepped back into a puddle earning myself a brusque “ watch your fucking step ” followed by a muttered “ asshole ”. I thought about pulling out the heavily modified P90 I kept under my jacket but I was already half a block away, and besides I was only licensed to kill highly modified genetic organisms, and caffeine laced DNA didn't quite meet that bar. Meanwhile my prey continued its uneven flight uptown. Technically it was not a dragon in the biblical sense, but a heavily edited komodo dragon. Sometimes I really wondered what those guys at Los Alamos were actually trying to achieve. Of course the military had promised some national defense application but had been vague on the details, and I suspect that a well worded grant from a bored scientist had more to do with my prey's existence than any actual well thought out defense purpose. Still I guess every program has its growing pains, but at least Australia seemed to have learned its lesson after the platypus incident. I'd laughed when my handler said I was being deployed covertly on a mission to NYC. I've done city work before, but usually for smaller “ collections ”. Rats were a preferred research target so of course I had spent a lot more time under the big apple than in it. How, I though, was I going to hide the fact that a fucking dragon was flying above a city of 10 million people. The point turned out to be moot. No New Yorker even looked up, they never even saw the dragon. Sure the tourists would stand on corners and point up, but this did not attract the attention of the locals any more than it ever had. The tourists themselves seemed to assume that if everyone else was ok with the hovering green beast that it must be a normal city thing. I saw it come in for a landing near central park and quickened my pace figuring that the shit was about to hit the fan. I found my dragon was lying stretched out along the coble stone walls that surround the park, just a few 10's of feet from the Met. The cries of terror I expected were not audible, instead I heard cheers and applause coming from a circle of people who had surrounded the dragon. In front of him, but within the circle formed by the crowd, was a knocked over kabob cart and he was lapping up small balls of meet with a flick of his tongue. The owner was nowhere to be seen, but people were throwing small denomination bills and coins into the overturned cart as they applauded. Sighing, I called my handler over the secure line in my headset. “ I'm gona need some backup for crowed control. ” Then after a second of though where I considered how poorly suited their usual camo was going to be in this crazy city. “ Dress them up as clowns, or zombies… or both. ” Edit: took some liberty with ""exotic"" hope that's cool",0
"Summary: Indictment: Man tried to pass nuclear filters to foreign agent. Roy Lynn Oakley appears in court in Tennessee after surrendering. Facility's role is to break down decommissioned equipment. Lawyer: Oakley's job was to break machine parts into pieces, pitch them. Article: A former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the United States at risk, the Department of Justice announced Thursday. Sources say the classified materials were taken from the East Tennessee Technology Park. Roy Lynn Oakley, 67, of Roane County, Tennessee, appeared in federal court in Knoxville on Thursday. Oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in January, when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials, government sources told CNN. He voluntarily surrendered Thursday at an FBI field office in Knoxville, the sources said. Oakley is a former employee of Bechtel Jacobs, the Department of Energy's prime environmental management contractor at the East Tennessee Technology Park, prosecutors said. The indictment states that Oakley, ""having possession of, access to and having been entrusted with sections of 'barriers' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the United States and secure an advantage to a foreign nation, did communicate, transmit and disclose such data to another person."" The transfer took place January 26, the indictment alleges. Oakley is also charged with converting the material and ""restricted data"" to his own use. He began doing so on about October 17, 2006, and continued through January, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them. Oakley's attorney, Herb Moncier, said outside court Thursday that Oakley's job was to break rods ""into little pieces"" and throw them away. Moncier said Oakley had a security clearance, but Moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance. The government alleges that in January, Oakley attempted to sell the ""pieces of scrap"" to someone he thought was a French agent -- but in reality was an undercover FBI agent, Moncier said. He said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an ""appliance"" under the law. ""Mr. Oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months,"" said Moncier, who added that he had traveled to Washington for work on the case. Each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. ""While none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization, the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands,"" Kenneth Wainstein, assistant attorney general for national security, said in the Justice Department statement. One government source said the materials involved are not the ""crown jewels,"" but they should not have been taken from the facility. A ""barrier"" is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process, according to nuclear energy officials, but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job. Sources told CNN that federal authorities have been following Oakley and investigating the case for at least six months, after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material. Oakley, described as a low-level employee, apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind, an official familiar with the case said. A government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of Oakley's alleged intentions six months ago, the FBI and Department of Energy launched a joint investigation. The FBI then developed a sting operation, government officials familiar with the case said, and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country. East Tennessee Technology Park is an area of the DOE's Oak Ridge reservation ""where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985,"" Gerald Boyd, manager of the DOE's Oak Ridge site office, said Thursday. ""When they were in use, now over 20 years ago, some of the buildings at ETTP housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium."" Boyd said the technology park and the reservation ""are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs, both visible and unseen, meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position."" In this case, a review of security procedures showed that the system worked and ""successfully identified the individual in question,"" he said.

"Summary: Majority Leader says a number of Dems are ""revisiting their own positions"" Turkey is upset about World War I ""genocide"" resolution in Congress. House resolution calls killing of Armenians ""genocide"" Incirlik Air Base is key point for U.S. military supply of Iraq mission. Article: Some Democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious House resolution labeling Turkey's treatment of Armenians in World War I as genocide. A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the ""genocide"" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. ""I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,"" said Hoyer of Maryland. ""I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions. We will have to determine where everybody is."" Democratic Rep. Ike Skelton, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, announced his opposition to the resolution last week. And Democratic Reps. Alcee Hastings of Florida and John Tanner of Tennessee, both members of the U.S. House delegation to NATO, urged Pelosi to reconsider in a letter released Tuesday. ""More than half of the cargo flown into Iraq and Afghanistan comes through Incirlik Air Base, and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future,"" they wrote. Lt. Gen. Carter Ham, the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Pentagon planners are looking at ""a broad range of options"" to keep food, fuel and ammunition flowing to U.S. troops in Iraq if Turkey blocks Incirlik. ""We're confident that we'll find ways to do that,"" Ham told reporters at the Pentagon. ""There's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that, and obviously we'd prefer to maintain the access that we have."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates echoed lawmakers' concerns last week. ""About 70 percent of all air cargo going into Iraq goes through Turkey. ... About a third of the fuel that they consume goes through Turkey or comes from Turkey,"" Gates said. He also said that 95 percent of the Mine-Resistant Ambush-Protective vehicles, or MRAPs, being deployed in Iraq are flown through Turkey. The vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs. See Incirlik's key location ». The U.S. military issued a ""warning order"" a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews, planes, fuel and routes are lined up if Turkey stops or restricts U.S. access to Incirlik, a source said. Jordan and Kuwait are among the alternatives the United States is considering. Some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the Turks to attack Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq which could further complicate Iraqi stability, U.S. officials said. Incirlik offers 10,000- and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters, according Globalsecurity.org, a source of background information about military issues. Globalsecurity said Incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to Iraq, taking over for Rhein-Main Air Base in Germany because it is closer to Iraq, reducing the strain on troops and aircraft.

"Prompt: The .1 % of germs left behind after hand sanitizer use is the deadliest of all, lying dormant in humans ... until now. Story: ""Could I have a large cappuccino to go please?"" I asked the man behind the counter. He was kind of cute, in a way, and the smile that he flashed at me almost turned my knees to water. He nodded and turned away to make my drink. It's stupid really. I've been coming here every day for the past month and I've never even asked him his name. He's the only one who works here at this time, so it's not like there would be anybody else watching. Just *talk* to him damn it! He handed me my coffee and smiled again, hinting that perhaps he felt the same way. Just as I opened my mouth to speak to him, I heard the door of the café open behind me as another customer walked in. ""Could I have a large...."" his order was cut short by a sudden intake of breath, which built up into a sneeze as he tipped his head back. I took a step away from him to avoid the blast zone, and the shout he gave out seemed to reverberate throughout the entire room in which we were standing. ""Bless you,"" the man behind the counter said, but his face fell when he looked closer at the man who had sneezed. He bent low over the ground, wheezing. A dreadful rattle that crawled its way out of his mouth, and a sickening wetness accompanied it. Still crouched over, he let out a short cough, and a fine spray of dark red blood hit the carpet. I was immediately by his side. ""Oh my god, are you okay?"" I asked him, immediately regretting my stupid question. ""Yeah, I'm fine. Its just..."" He coughed again, this time spewing a thick blob of bloody phlegm onto the cream coloured carpet, which rapidly darkened as the liquid soaked into it. He erupted into a coughing fit at that point, the spasms wracking his body as he fell to the floor. His arms thudded against the floor as he thrashed wildly, all the while emitted a deep moan that gurgled at sporadic intervals. Eventually he fell still, and the noise stopped almost as abruptly as they had begun. His eyes, although aimed at the ceiling, seemed unfocussed. A thick stream of blood poured out of the corners of his mouth, and the flesh of his lips appeared bruised and rough, almost as if something was forcing its way through the skin. As I pressed two fingers against his neck to check for a pulse, the skin split like an overripe fruit, spilling black, foul-smelling flesh out of his body. I tried to stifle a gag as the disgusting substance flopped onto the floor. ""Call an ambulance!"" I nearly screamed, barely even turning my head, but noticing he had already begun to do so. When I looked back at the man on the floor, the black gunge seemed to be turning white, and the surface of it seemed to become almost hairy. Some part of my brain screamed a warning. *Don't Touch. * It echoed over and over again. I made the mistake then of breathing in, which finally caused me to retch and vomit, the slime covering the body that I was fairly certain was dead at this point. As I watched, however, the white hairs seemed to be creeping outwards, already dragging themselves over the fresh vomit, almost as if searching for it. I stared in horror as the skin began to ripple and bulge, splitting further down the body as the clothes began to stain black and the stench rose, as the first of the sirens began to fill the air.",0
