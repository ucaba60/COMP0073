The two men snarl and grab at eachother, grappling in the small foxhole. Abruptly, their faces come together. \"Clancy?\" \"Rob?\" Rob Hall, 97, Corporal in the 50-100 army grins, as the situation turns from life or death struggle, to a meeting of two college friends. He lets go of Marguerian's collar. \"Holy shit Clancy, you're the last person I expected to see here\" \"Yeah\" \"Shit man, I didn't think I'd ever see'Mr. volunteers every saturday morning at the food shelf', not after The Reorganization at least\" \"Yeah Rob, it is something isn't it\" \"Man, I'm sorry I tried to kill you there, hey, I heard you guys were out of food, here, you can share my dinner\" Clancy marvels, even after all this: The Reorganization, the coalitions, the war, Rob is still his old, chatty self. The two men sit, Rob chatting away, Clancy forcing out pleasantries. They pass Rob's rations between them. \"Clancy my man, I heard a group of terrorist 5's took have formed some kind of cult, and they're rallying all the < 50 in their own coalition\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"Yeah, I mean, that sucks and everything, cause those are some scary dudes, but I heard that there's going to be a truce between our countries in a few days, why don't we just hang out here, pretty soon we won't even be enemies anymore!\" \"Yeah, Rob, that sounds like a plan\" \"Man, I'm so glad I found you again, in a few days, this war will be over, and things will be cool between us and, hey, remember Sarah? I heard she's a 151, maybe I'll look her up, I'll be sure to visit you too once I can get a pass to sector 150-155, it'll probably be tough though, even before the war, you had to do sooo much paperwork to be allowed to visit, I wonder if passes will even be reinstated after the truce ends, hey, did I ever tell you about the time...\" Rob babbles as he dozes off, grinning up at Clancy. When Clancy is sure that his friend is asleep, he slits Rob's throat with his bayonet. Clancy climbs out of the foxhole, and stumbles his way back to battalion HQ.\n",

      "Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported £20 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films. Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest ». There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \"My Boy Jack,\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \"December Boys,\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \"Equus.\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\" he told Reuters.\n",

      "('Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer: Results depicted mitochondrial dynamics in vivo as PCD progresses within the lace plant, and highlight the correlation of this organelle with other organelles during developmental PCD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mitochondria and chloroplasts moving on transvacuolar strands to form a ring structure surrounding the nucleus during developmental PCD. Also, for the first time, we have shown the feasibility for the use of CsA in a whole plant system. Overall, our findings implicate the mitochondria as playing a critical and early role in developmentally regulated PCD in the lace plant.', 0)\n"
