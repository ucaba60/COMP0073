      "You get a deep cut for the first time in your life, instead of bone or muscle, you see wires. When it happened, a wave of understanding surged through my soul. It occured while I prepped food. My fish knife lost control, and tore open a flimsy section of skin. It stang, but only on the edges. Morbid curiosity lead me to look inside the dry'wound'. A flashlight revealed that inside my left arm was a complex tangle of brightly coloured cables, motors. and most certainly not biological material. They always spoke in the news about Reploids: Replication Androids. Rumour said that they kill the original human, then, wearing an artificial meatsack replica, took their place. Their motives were unknown, even to me, who apparently was one of them. Reploids are often hated, though they tend to'disappear' when outed. I grabbed some duct tape, and patched up my arm. I'll find something better tomorrow. -- - \"Baa.\" modulated the electric sheep. -- - I woke up with a start. My alarm clock buzzed, and I smacked the button on top. I dressed myself groggily, some dim part of me thinking'silver'. I put my glasses on, and tightened my nifty digital watch. *Silver. * *Silver? * As I buttoned my cuffs, I finally saw the duct tape. Then everything went nuts. My vision went red, and a targeting recticle appeared in my vision. > -- -DynaOS Active. Infiltration Signal Recieved. Hello, Dave. -- - \"What?

I'm not Dave?\" > DEFINE (Dave) ``.... Well, I like tabletop games, pink haired ladies with loose natures but strong morals...\" > You are Dave enough to fool Dave. He'd know, he made you. \"Explain.\" > Dave was chosen for his great compassion and love of humanity. You are designed to maximise his goals for the future of mankind. \"You....
