"Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer:  Yes, mitochondrial respiratory system is involved in remodelling of cell surface which in turn acts as a regulator of cell morphology. However, this effect is not at the cellular level and is observed only when mitochondria are targeted by other substances such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrion has a major role in regeneration and regulation of cell morphology in plants thanks to the regulation of ROS by mitochondria and ROS production by mitochondria.

Dietary composition and mitochondrial damage

Mitochondria are responsible for breaking down the main components of plant cell tissue, especially carbohydrates of plant cells and carbohydrates in protein complexes of plant cells. These are in addition to oxidative proteins that are secreted by the mitochondria from inside the cell. Mitochondria are found in the mitochondria of all known plants. These mitochondria (monosomy 21) have several functions which are important in plant cell metabolism and in the regulation of cell death.

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption

Mitochondria use oxygen as a major energy source for the activity of their mitochondria. When the cell is in thermal (overheated) condition, mitochondria emit electrons. This energy is used for the processes of oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids, to increase the oxidation of NADH and to reduce oxidizability of fatty acids. Mitochondrial respiration also stimulates the reactions of lactic acid, glutaminase-mediated gluconeogenesis and protein hydrolysis.

Mitochondrial respiration and lipid peroxidation

The reduction of oxidized fat in plants results in the catabolism of saturated fatty acids, particularly by the production of acetate, lactate and pyruvate. These reactions of the phospholipids that are derived from carbohydrate of cells have a major role and are important for plant cell metabolism and in regulation of organ and tissue function. This is the first step in the conversion of cell proteins and carbohydrates into energy.

F recycle for ATP synthesis

Each mitochondria has19 ATP synthase enzymes from which it can generate ATP that the mitochondria can use to perform various biochemical and biologic functions. These enzymes include NAD+ catalytic enzyme (NADH+ catalysed oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids), the mitochondrial β-hydroxylase (β-OHCAΔ), the SOD enzymes (soluble) and the cytosolic NAD(+. These enzymes are present in all cells of plants. These enzymes contribute to the conversion of one form of carbohydrate into another which is necessary for most chemical processes of plants, such as energy production, amino acids synthesis and nucleotide synthesis.

Mitochondria promote growth during plant cell division

Protein content of leaves

Leaf-producing tissues of plants such as leaves consist of a large number of different cell types and cell types are highly variable. Plant cells differentiate in three distinct phases: stem, roots and shoot. Plant cells of stems are divided into cells by a series of elongated tubular units (ploidys). Plant cell bodies are divided vertically into cell layers of leaves that can be in the form of cells without azinskiules such as pistillate (without a leaf cell body and a basal cytoplasmic layer and usually without a nucleus).

For a larger picture, see the diagram below

Leaf-forming organs and cells include a number of different organelles such as stomata, leaflets, hairs, pistils, sepals, leaves and the roots, flowering bulb, fruits, stems and roots. Cells of roots, flowers, pistils and natal flowers are divided in various areas with basal cells, basal stomata, apicardium and apical chambers. There are numerous specialized organs in the root of plants such as the root of the genus Heliconius and the trachoma. In addition to specialized organs, cells of flowers are divided into cells with various types of organelles such as papill divides, stamens, pistillates and trichomes.

Leaves form a set of cells in the upper part of the plant body including the apical and basal cells, the apicardium, apical chambers, the stamens and the stamens.

Carbon

Carbon is formed in the intercellular spaces of the plants stem or leaves. Carbon is essential for most organic chemical reactions. It also forms a major part of cells of plant tissue, especially plants stem, roots, fruits and shoots. Carbon also plays a crucial part in plant cell regulation and development.

Carbon molecules are found mainly in the outer and inner membranes of plant cells. For example, the outer-membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria, the inner membrane of chloroplasts, the inner membranes of chloroplasts, the nucleus of chloroplasts and cytoplasm of the cells of root",1
