Question: Do mitochondria play a role in remodelling lace plant leaves during programmed cell death? Answer:," Yes, mitochondrial respiratory system is involved in remodelling of cell surface which in turn acts as a regulator of cell morphology. However, this effect is not at the cellular level and is observed only when mitochondria are targeted by other substances such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrion has a major role in regeneration and regulation of cell morphology in plants thanks to the regulation of ROS by mitochondria and ROS production by mitochondria.

Dietary composition and mitochondrial damage

Mitochondria are responsible for breaking down the main components of plant cell tissue, especially carbohydrates of plant cells and carbohydrates in protein complexes of plant cells. These are in addition to oxidative proteins that are secreted by the mitochondria from inside the cell. Mitochondria are found in the mitochondria of all known plants. These mitochondria (monosomy 21) have several functions which are important in plant cell metabolism and in the regulation of cell death.

Mitochondrial oxygen consumption

Mitochondria use oxygen as a major energy source for the activity of their mitochondria. When the cell is in thermal (overheated) condition, mitochondria emit electrons. This energy is used for the processes of oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids, to increase the oxidation of NADH and to reduce oxidizability of fatty acids. Mitochondrial respiration also stimulates the reactions of lactic acid, glutaminase-mediated gluconeogenesis and protein hydrolysis.

Mitochondrial respiration and lipid peroxidation

The reduction of oxidized fat in plants results in the catabolism of saturated fatty acids, particularly by the production of acetate, lactate and pyruvate. These reactions of the phospholipids that are derived from carbohydrate of cells have a major role and are important for plant cell metabolism and in regulation of organ and tissue function. This is the first step in the conversion of cell proteins and carbohydrates into energy.

F recycle for ATP synthesis

Each mitochondria has19 ATP synthase enzymes from which it can generate ATP that the mitochondria can use to perform various biochemical and biologic functions. These enzymes include NAD+ catalytic enzyme (NADH+ catalysed oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids), the mitochondrial β-hydroxylase (β-OHCAΔ), the SOD enzymes (soluble) and the cytosolic NAD(+. These enzymes are present in all cells of plants. These enzymes contribute to the conversion of one form of carbohydrate into another which is necessary for most chemical processes of plants, such as energy production, amino acids synthesis and nucleotide synthesis.

Mitochondria promote growth during plant cell division

Protein content of leaves

Leaf-producing tissues of plants such as leaves consist of a large number of different cell types and cell types are highly variable. Plant cells differentiate in three distinct phases: stem, roots and shoot. Plant cells of stems are divided into cells by a series of elongated tubular units (ploidys). Plant cell bodies are divided vertically into cell layers of leaves that can be in the form of cells without azinskiules such as pistillate (without a leaf cell body and a basal cytoplasmic layer and usually without a nucleus).

For a larger picture, see the diagram below

Leaf-forming organs and cells include a number of different organelles such as stomata, leaflets, hairs, pistils, sepals, leaves and the roots, flowering bulb, fruits, stems and roots. Cells of roots, flowers, pistils and natal flowers are divided in various areas with basal cells, basal stomata, apicardium and apical chambers. There are numerous specialized organs in the root of plants such as the root of the genus Heliconius and the trachoma. In addition to specialized organs, cells of flowers are divided into cells with various types of organelles such as papill divides, stamens, pistillates and trichomes.

Leaves form a set of cells in the upper part of the plant body including the apical and basal cells, the apicardium, apical chambers, the stamens and the stamens.

Carbon

Carbon is formed in the intercellular spaces of the plants stem or leaves. Carbon is essential for most organic chemical reactions. It also forms a major part of cells of plant tissue, especially plants stem, roots, fruits and shoots. Carbon also plays a crucial part in plant cell regulation and development.

Carbon molecules are found mainly in the outer and inner membranes of plant cells. For example, the outer-membrane of chloroplasts and mitochondria, the inner membrane of chloroplasts, the inner membranes of chloroplasts, the nucleus of chloroplasts and cytoplasm of the cells of root"

"Question: Syncope during bathing in infants, a pediatric form of water-induced urticaria? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:","

Answer: 1) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a sudden unexplained death that can be associated with drowning, as well as many other traumatic events. In the last 50 years, about 500,000 children have died of SIDS, and half of these have occurred at bath time. It is estimated that between 1% and 18% of all children over the age of 1 year will have SIDS when the infant is young enough to be swimming in water.

2) Water-induced urticaria is a temporary water rash that occurs about one hour later. It is usually mild, nonspecific, and is often overlooked.

3) Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a rare, sudden death occurring in infants less than one year of age. Almost all deaths from drowning occur in infants less than one year of age. Nearly all the SIDS cases occur when an infant is in the bathtub or tub after a bath or bath.

4) The risk factors for SIDS include a bath at home, a short bathtime, being on your stomach, not wearing seat belts, being on a hot tub and the bathtub is a short distance away. If you have a short bathtime, make sure you have a good curtain.

5) Infants need several exposures to air to get enough oxygen to oxygenate their blood. You are less likely to experience excessive water and sudsy body fluids if you have a long exposure time.

6) Bathers should always wear life jackets and protective neck gear in a case of water intoxication. Some people do not have the ability to swim so wearing safety belts can be a good precaution.

7) In addition, make sure kids are in their seats when they go in or out of the water. This helps prevent drownings that could happen from sudden immersion in water.

8) A child can die of water intoxication after only one brief exposure to a short bath. There is no safe amount of time until exposure to water. If your family is planning an outdoor bath or bath time on a hot day, consider using an air tight tub or a safety belt.


Question: What is the link between SIDS and bath-time water intoxication? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:

Answer: Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is an unexpected sudden loss of consciousness. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, SIDS rates increased significantly in the United States by a factor of more than 1.5. These increased SIDS rates were followed by a more than 30 fold increase in the rates of water water intoxication in the same regions. SIDS is more likely when babies are younger and more often occurs with other risk factors.

9) Bathers need to take additional precautions if a child is going for a ride with friends or family members. If he or she is swimming in the tub or bath, make sure the child is wearing a life jacket and have a good curtain.

10) A large amount of water in the bathtub can cause an allergic reaction. This can lead to seizures and death. When children are under 10, they shouldn't use a bath tub for more than one or two hours at a time.

Question: Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can tailored interventions increase mammography use among HMO women?

Answer: Yes.

Question: What is the most cost-effective way to encourage HMO enrollees to wear breast implants? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What is the most cost-effective way to encourage HMO enrollees to wear breast implants?

Answer: In patients who have undergone a breast biopsy, the majority of implant-related complications will be treated at the expense of insurance coverage. Breast implants are expensive to repair and will cost thousands in treatment and rehabilitation in addition to the cost of treating the implants. The most cost-effective approach for women who undergo biopsies to confirm breast implant implantation is to refer them to a breast surgeon willing to perform the surgery at an acceptable cost.

Question: What specific preventive services are covered for breast cancer screening by the Affordable Care Act? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: What specific preventive services are covered for breast cancer screening by the Affordable Care Act?

Answer: Comprehensive mammograms are covered for all women, not just those for whom insurance pays for surgery. Screening for breast cancer with ultrasound is excluded. The ACA is very supportive of breast cancer screening. In the end, breast cancer screening is usually more cost-effective than other kinds of preventive services, and it is often recommended for women on the lower income end of the spectrum."
Question: Double balloon enteroscopy: is it efficacious and safe in a community setting? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

SUMMARY: What is the consensus view on what is considered the gold standard for both surgery and endoscopy?

A. The consensus view is that the open flap procedure (FL) is acceptable in the context of open-heart surgery, but only if the first-degree sonographer in the clinical practice is capable of performing the technique safely for a large number of patients.

B. The consensus view is that the double balloon insert in the open-heart and paravalvular surgeries (AP) are acceptable when a single balloon inflating device (OBD) is used in the treatment.

C. The consensus view is that the open-heart bypassing (OBB) is acceptable for patients with a low risk of significant complications from a single balloon operation, but only in the setting of an active cardiac catheterization process.

D. The consensus view is that the double balloon insert in the paravalvular surgery (AP) is unacceptable for all other patients unless the first degree sonographer is capable of performing the technique safely for a large number of patients.

The literature shows that the best practice for OBD procedures (the type of operation performed by the first-degree sonographer) is to perform the OBD on a low-risk patient. In those patients, surgical approaches in addition to the surgical technique in the open-heart and paravalvular surgeries must be considered. In these studies, the surgical approaches included: obstructed access and the use of a defibrillator (cardiovascular catheterization). In this report, the first-degree sonographer in the surgery and the obstructed access group used a large OBD device to provide the defibrillator. The other group (the obstructed access and the single balloon insertion) used either the balloon insertion or the balloon inflator in the treatment. The primary outcome measure is the rate of failure to thrive (TFST).

The literature also suggests that the number of patients successfully treated with the single balloon insert varies. A study performed in Australia that followed more than 700 patients for over four years found that those patients treated with both devices found greater improvement compared to those treated with balloon insertion alone. Patients treated with balloon insertion alone were found to be more likely to have a higher complication rate. The literature was sparse for the use of a single balloon insertion for endoscopy. In a survey of the literature, 10 authors observed that a single balloon insert is not recommended for endoscopic use. 2

We studied two patient cohorts to determine how similar the results could be between these two cohorts. We performed randomized controlled trials using the same treatment approach (double balloon insert versus balloon insertion in the treatment) and same population of patients to examine whether the single balloon insertion is always as efficacious and safe for every patient as its conventional counterpart with the same procedure. We also studied the outcomes for endoscopic and surgical outcomes. A third study looked at the role of risk adjusting and complications and found that a single balloon insert is probably more effective for these outcomes in a cohort (n = 464 patients) of patients treated with open-heart surgery. 1 This study also showed that the use of a single balloon insert may increase the potential for side effects and may not be as reliable at identifying patients who are at increased risk.

We used data from the study performed by Miller et al 1 in the United Kingdom. The results are summarized in. The study was a large, prospective, observational study to evaluate the results of a single balloon insert for endoscopy performed on large, otherwise healthy, patients (n = 1512) with a history of prior open-heart surgery or a history of an acute open-heart episode. To evaluate the effect of the single balloon insert on patients at high (n = 2085 patients) or low risk of adverse outcome (n = 1260 patients) the authors utilized a double-blind method to assess the success of the procedure based on patients' self-reported outcome measure (TFST). All patients were admitted to a hospital with the intent to follow their medical care at the hospital. This study included 2478 patients over 28 days.

The primary outcome measure used in the studies is the TFT, which is a visual assessment of the amount of bleeding that occurred in the patient, with an algorithm that describes the flow of blood through the patient for a given time interval and level of pain. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who had TFTs with a level of pain equal to or better than the median for a clinically significant change of 3 mm or less of blood between the time of the first TFT and the time that the patient received the recommended therapy from the cardiologist.

An important aspect to consider when interpreting the data is the degree of patient bias (whether or not there is a difference between the 2 groups). The authors"

Question: Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is adjustment for reporting heterogeneity necessary in sleep disorders? Abstract and citation information in the Supplement are available upon request.

The following was discussed in the discussion: A review of the literature regarding the use of adjustment for reporting heterogeneity and conclusions to date are discussed. In order to provide a basis for a final recommendation on adjusting for reporting heterogeneity, the following adjustments or additions were proposed: Considerations of subgroup characteristics between subgroups were evaluated. The impact of adjustments were compared with those for comparisons of the same subgroup with and without the adjustment. When possible, measures of differences between subgroups were analyzed. Differences between subgroups in the number of hours in each of four morning meal types were examined.

The following items were reviewed: Studies evaluating the impact of adjustment for reporting heterogeneity on the association between sleep duration and health outcomes and are primarily of interest were reviewed. Data were extracted into separate tables by the authors and summarized according to the following categories: No adjustments;

Adjustments for covariates;

Subgroup measures of effect such as gender, health behavior, level of education, work histories, ethnicity, body mass index, ethnicity, and sleep duration by education, race/ethnicity, and total hours spent in bed and bedtimes.

The following issues were evaluated in detail: (1) Subgroup characteristics of the subpopulations examined; (2) Adjustments for covariates;

Does this study adequately account for the possibility that non–individual differences in response to meal frequency or the number of hours in bed and bedtimes contribute to the association between sleep duration and health outcomes?

Two reviewers (RM and JF) independently reviewed each of the citations reported in the search strategy and synthesized the information to formulate a consensus statement concerning the issues discussed.

Finally, each author wrote a list of recommendations that would further our understanding of the relationship between sleep deprivation and health outcomes. For this purpose, two reviewers (GRS and ESM) independently evaluated each recommendation.

Conclusions of the Recommendations

Recommendations for Health Monitoring of Long-term Sleep Restriction

Recommendation 1: Evaluate sleep durations, other environmental factors, and health behaviors to ensure the validity of the association between sleep deprivation and health outcomes.

Recommendation 2: Implement research on sleep durations and other environmental factors to establish that sleep-related health effects are real and measurable and to guide sleep durations in accordance with evidence-based recommendations.

Recommendation 3: Monitor trends in daytime sleepiness patterns and health outcomes through an epidemiological review.

Recommendation 4: Study and evaluate the relationship between sleep duration and disease-specific outcomes in the population.

Recommendation 5: Consider adjustment for reporting heterogeneity for observational research.

Recommendation 6: Establish consistent sleep-related body mass index standards; standardize meal timing standards; design and implement national standards to monitor overweight and obesity; develop and implement national sleep training programs; implement national standards for bedtimes and early bedtimes.

Question: Do mutations causing low HDL-C promote increased carotid intima-media thickness? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Does low LDL-C promote increased intima-media thickness? Why do low HDL-C promote increased intima-media thickness? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and blood vessel atherosclerosis? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and arterial calcification? What are the clinical implications of the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and acute coronary syndrome? What are the clinical implications of the association between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and coronary calcification and heart diseases?

Answer:

1) Low HDL does not cause arterial calcification, and the association observed between the low-hMG-cholesterol gene and blood vessel atherosclerosis remains unknown.

2) A plausible mechanism why low HDL causes arterial calcification is that it promotes lipid storage in subclinical atherosclerotic plaques that are rapidly developing within the arterial wall.

3) The high frequency of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is in large part attributable to a complex interaction between a genetic predisposition associated with low HDL levels and a complex metabolic response to insulin resistance that occurs early in life.

4) The high frequency of cardiovascular death, stroke, and sudden death is largely due to a complex interaction between a genetic predisposition associated with low HDL levels and a complex metabolic response to low HDL levels.

Question: How can you prevent high-glucose diet-induced metabolic syndrome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: How can you prevent high-glucose diet-induced metabolic syndrome?

Answer:

1) The risk of metabolic syndrome increases significantly when plasma glucose rises from normal glucose levels after consuming a very high-calorie (25% kcal/day) high-fructose (HFD) diet for 1 week.

2) Low-glycemic index (LGI) diets have been shown to reduce plasma glucose levels while increasing HDL-C levels. A low-glycemic index diet increases HDL with a concomitant reduction in LDL and increases HDL with a concomitant concomitant increase in triglyceride (TG). To investigate the effect of these dietary changes on glucose homeostasis, healthy subjects were given 2 doses of a low-glycemic index (LGI) diet and followed 4 weeks later by the same low-glycemic index (LGI) diet. Plasma glucose, insulin, and lipids were determined.

3) Glucose homeostasis is impaired in persons with both severe polyglutaminergic diabetes mellitus as defined by the American Diabetes Association criteria and insulin resistance caused by polyglutaminergic disease.

4) As described in the context of insulin resistance, ""Insulin resistance causes dysregulation of glucose metabolism by upregulation of glycogen synthesis and depletions of the lipolytic enzymes as well as reduced levels of phospholipase A2 and beta-1-hydroxylase. These cellular responses are known to be related to impaired ability of the beta-cell to maintain the adequate glucose supply to skeletal muscle fibres of adults with various types of polyglutaminergic diabetes mellitus.""

Question: Does a high-protein diet cause insulin resistance? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Does a high-protein diet cause insulin resistance?

Answer:

1) High protein intake is associated with reduced glucose and insulin levels, but there are no differences in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations if subjects consume a high-calorie (25% kcal/day) high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet for 10 weeks before or after another 9-week high-protein (∼25% kcal/day) diet.

2) Plasma glucose concentration increases with the consumption of a high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet.

3) After consuming a high-protein (∼20% kcal/day) diet, subjects have a higher insulin response than subjects consuming a low-protein (∼10% kcal/day) diet.

4) The insulin sensitivity index (ISI), the ratio of total to HDL response to insulin (ΔI/ΔH), is significantly increased in subjects consuming a high-protein diet compared to subjects consuming a low-protein (∼10% kcal/day) high-protein diet.

Question: A short stay or 23-hour ward in a general and academic children's hospital: are they effective? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Q: One or two days of residential, long-term, or short-stay hospitalization for a child and/or pregnant woman, with their primary caregiver. How effective is these placements?

Answer: These types of placements are not very effective at preventing mortality.

1. Residential placements of infants in adult homes, typically in infant dormitories, with the infants' primary caregivers. Such placements (4 or more days) typically have a short duration and no long-term benefits. (8)

2. Long-term nursing house placements in infant care facilities. These placements (1 to 2 years) with primary caregivers may be effective at preventing death (3). (3.1)

3. Intensive outpatient hospitalized children's homes for infants, children not in nursing homes, and mothers between 42-46 years of age. These placements have a longer duration and are more likely to be of long-term benefit than other types of placements. (5)

4. Intensive outpatient community residential for children between 25 to 29 years. These placements are also of longer duration than inpatient placements and more likely to be of long-term benefit than other types of placements. However, studies that examined mortality were unable to find evidence that children assigned this type of placement lived longer on average than other children of similar ages. These studies also have a poor follow-up and are limited by being observational studies of children between 25 and 29. (5)

5. Residential hospitals for infants and young children between 5 and 15 years (3.8 million), children of either racial/ethnic groups, or age- and sex-matched comparison groups.

6. Extended-stay inpatient facilities (hospital beds for 24 hours or more) for infants, children, pregnant women and other pediatric patients. These facilities are less durable than inpatient residential placements and have less benefit when compared with other types of long-term inpatient placements on mortality and morbidity. (5)

7. All-day residential hospitals for infants, children, pregnant women and children between 5 and 19 years. These facility-based facilities are less durable when compared with other types of longer-lasting placements on mortality.

8. Intensive outpatient hospitalization for infants between 25 and 29 years. These hospital-based hospital units are less durable on mortality than general hospitalization units and most studies have demonstrated poor follow-up and are limited by being observational studies of infant health.

One of the most important studies of such outcomes that have been completed to date was that of Fava and colleagues (25), which examined the mortality of 3,634 infants (1,816 infants and 787 children) who received a mean of four or more days of hospitalization between July 1991 and June 1992. There were 1,200 deaths, a death rate of 17.7 per 1,000 infant days received, a significant reduction from the previous year, and a significant reduction from the mortality rate of 17.1 per 1,000 days received over the previous five years. In comparison, a mean of 1,087 infants (836 infants and 793 children) received general hospitalization and died on average 1.7 days later. For comparison purposes, a five-year mean mortality rate was also taken from the same study, and we have used this data for the following analyses.

An earlier report of the study and its follow-up methods appeared in Pediatrics in 1996 (33), in which the authors described the outcome data from two observational studies of the benefit or lack thereof of intensive outpatient hospitalization compared with general hospitalization (n = 1,700 infants; n = 948 children). Those studies found no effect for deaths on days when infants were hospitalized for observation after the birth of an infant but some reductions in days when infants were hospitalized for observation had occurred. For more recent data, see the information provided in this report.

Most recently, a study of infant mortality rates in five-year age categories found no significant difference in the rate of death among neonates in intensive outpatient units compared with short-stay beds (5). The authors also compared infants with short-stay inpatient inpatient units with those who received general hospitals. The results of this article have been published online in Pediatrics. (27)

One of the more surprising studies of inpatient morbidity and mortality that is currently being performed for this report and others is the study of Nieswander and colleagues (35). This study of more than 24,000 children aged 9 through 21 years at a special pediatric hospital in the Northeast had the largest number of infants receiving acute psychiatric inpatient care: 3,811 of which received acute psychiatric inpatient treatment. It also had the largest follow-"
Question: Did Chile's traffic law reform push police enforcement? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Did Latin America's traffic law reform push police enforcement?

Answer: Not in the 1990s. It did not.

Answer: It started to. The 1990s saw a dramatic push to pass new laws and policies designed to discourage speeding and road rage, especially in Latin America.

Question: Why did the U.S. speed control laws become an international legal standard?

Answer: Traffic laws are rules imposed by authorities, and these rules are universal in every part of the world, regardless of political and cultural differences. International conventions have an important but inescapable flaw: The rules are usually more of a guide -- even the ones about speed limits or license-plate numbers -- than a reality check.

Question: Why did police begin focusing exclusively on serious accidents early in the 1970s?

Answer: They needed to make more arrests. There were too few arrests, and police could not use their resources to catch the kind of reckless drivers that contributed to those serious accidents. In part, this meant making a ""show-me"" approach, by focusing on breaking up accidents and then sending offenders to jail. Another part was to force speeders to spend more time behind bars because they were expensive to keep behind bars for longer. It is also well documented, as were many of these programs, with police, that the more you can spend on arresting speeders, the less you can spend on making other cases and convictions.

Question: Why have some of these policies been so successful? Why did these policies take root so fast?

Answer: The biggest factor was a combination of factors: the availability of information technology, police and judicial resources, public opinion, and an institutional culture of enforcement: officers were encouraged to find and pursue offenders, police chiefs often made traffic offenses their first priority in their first year on the job, and many jurisdictions were heavily influenced by the federal government.

Question: Is there a need to revise current law, in particular traffic law, in the US? Are there alternatives? Why hasn't it happened?

Answer: We don't know. But if you were to take a close look at U.S. policy, you'll find a long list of policies that haven't gone anywhere, including the current high-speed limits on highways, higher insurance rates, more aggressive citation systems for speeding, mandatory minimum sentences, enhanced penalties for driving while intoxicated, and high-speed camera enforcement.

Question: What does this have to do with the question: Are traffic laws changing? Or are they maintaining the same state of affairs?

Answer: As I've written on many occasions, I do not believe the two are linked. (See also my previous article on the topic.) The speed limits and the increased criminal penalties they are a result of is a real trend on the ground, and it has been evident for a few decades.

Question: Is it time to re-think the US traffic laws?

Answer: As for the future of a traffic law, I don't think it's an unimportant question. My view (and that of others who have written about changes that are occurring) is that our current system is very good and it is getting better. (My view on the current system is here.)

More background for the reader — including an extensive discussion of the history of the traffic laws in the US — is included in our previous article on this topic.

Question: Differentiation of nonalcoholic from alcoholic steatohepatitis: are routine laboratory markers useful? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Do routine laboratory markers of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NSHE) are useful in detecting the diagnosis? If so, what other laboratory markers are useful?

Answer: These markers are used in some diagnostic laboratories, to determine if a patient does or does not need to undergo CT or MR imaging. All of these markers involve the production of a ""chemical messenger"" called glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) - the enzyme which converts glutamic acid to glutamate. One marker is called the ""non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug anti-thyroid (NSAID) anti-glutamate (Glu-glu) monoclonal antibody"" (NSL-GABA) - this test measure the anti-inflammatory action of the NSAID. The other markers are the antibodies against specific types of proteins on the surface of NSHE - GAD and Glu-glu. NSL-GABA is known to be a useful marker of the NSHE, as well as its correlation with CT imaging. However, other markers for NSHEs are more difficult to use. Thus, one need only be mindful of the presence or lack of GAD enzymes to determine whether the patients is NSHE. As such, these markers need to be routinely measured before and after CT or MR imaging, to make sure that they will be able to identify NSHEs as well. They are not reliable or validated tests to diagnose NSHE. The following is a list of some markers for different types of NSHEs: NSHE monoclonal antibody, IgG (IgG anti-GAD)

The U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS) reported in the United States that there were 1,085,200 adults aged 14 years or older, of whom 633,600 were vaccinated in the 2011-12 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey. This is an increase of 2.2% from the 2013-14 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey which was conducted for the first time using a sample representative of the U.S. population.

The average age for vaccinated people was 36.2 years old, which is 5% higher than the 2012 USPHS Vaccine Use Survey estimate of age 36.3. The gap in age between vaccinated and unvaccinated in the United States has increased over the past 25 years. In 1972, the average age gap was only 0.7 years which has widened to 6 months. Currently, the gap in age between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults in the United States is at an all-time high of 10 years.

While it may not seem like it, the difference in average age between vaccinated and unvaccinated adults is an important indicator of socioeconomic status. It shows the number of adults without health coverage relative to the population at large. In other words, the percentage of people who are unvaccinating or unable to have the vaccine does not reflect the health status of those who are immunized. Additionally, the population percentage for that age gap has been decreasing steadily over the years.


In 2012, about 9% of the population aged 15 to 49 years in the U.S. was not vaccinated.

In 2013, the U.S. population aged 15–49 years was at its lowest number of unvaccinated individuals in the history of the USPHS Vaccine Use Survey since its inception. For the first time in history, the U.S. population aged 15 to 49 years was below the national estimate of unvaccinated individuals for the entire year. In addition, the proportion of infants aged 6 months and older in the U.S. who were vaccinated at age 12 or older stood at 63%.

If the current trends of declining vaccination rates continue, the U.S. population will be unable to adequately protect itself from a number of serious bacterial and viruses that are transmitted by medical procedures and by those who come in contact with a person who is not fully vaccinated, and can lead to serious infection. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends for the general population that everyone 13 years and older receive a vaccine dose at least 2 years prior to travelling to an area with high risk for a high prevalence of polio, including China, India, and Pakistan; and for those age 16 and older, that they receive a 5-dose vaccine series if staying for an extended period of time in an area where polio is present.

Although vaccines are not without risk, the U.S. Government, CDC, FDA and others are committed to protecting the average U.S. citizen against all diseases, including the most feared virus that is linked in epidemiological studies to deadly outcomes — the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

In 2013, the CDC said the estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States rose 18% to more than 13.3 million. Of those 13.3 million new infections (1.6% of total new infections), more than half (49%) are in adults ages 25 to 34. The number of new infections has remained relatively stable for the past 3 years, and no HIV infection for men infected by the male-to-female type of HIV, including males of all age groups, was reported for 2013, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

However, it has been noted that not everyone will get the vaccine or benefit the risk level of protection from having the vaccine or from using it to prevent an infection from becoming more severe.

When someone comes in contact with someone who has been protected from a virus and who does not have the vaccine or"
Question: Is there a model to teach and practice retroperitoneoscopic nephrectomy? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," 1. What are some scientific studies supporting how this procedure is better than open-heart surgery for the treatment of patients with difficult-to-control end-stage renal disease? 2. What are some studies showing that nephrectomy may be more useful than open-heart surgery for the treatment of patients who are at low risk of developing an early kidney disease (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, acute tubular necrosis, acute kidney injury, acute renal failure, diabetic uremic syndrome)?

Response and discussion : The consensus that the main benefit of doing an open-heart surgery is that is most commonly gained after the surgery itself has been completed. This benefit is not as strong as it seems and does reduce the number of operations performed but is better than what many are advocating for the practice of nephrectomy. Many surgeons have been experimenting with nephrectomy for use in patients who have severe heart failure but who have not received renal transplantation. It is not clear whether the extra benefit to the patient is worth the cost of the surgery at this time. There is also a risk of major complications post-op due simply to the fact that renal transplantation does not take place until the kidneys have developed. If there is a great improvement in renal function following this procedure, it may not take long for the kidneys to develop. However, if there are worsening renal function before or after this procedure, it raises the question of whether an intra-operative blood transfusion is warranted and whether surgery should be done anyway. The choice is not as clear as the authors suggest, particularly if the patient is not particularly robust or has other serious complications that require surgery.

The choice is not as clear as the authors suggest, particularly if the patient is not particularly robust or has other serious complications that require surgery. Discussion: Although there are many differences between the procedures in this article, the authors should be commended for including discussion of the possible advantages of surgical techniques. However, it should be noted that many of the factors they list are of no benefit to the average person (i.e., a patient with normal renal function, a risk of major complications, etc.) and are the opposite of what many are advocating in the medical community. Many people who are willing to try the surgery may have little hope of achieving good results either because the operation is too risky or because there are factors, such as a pre-established kidney dysfunction, which would make this surgery unwise.

Post operative care : After surgery, nephrectomy offers the most improvement for the patient than any other surgical technique to date. It was initially believed that the only significant post-op complication would be an end stage hip fracture but these studies may have over-stated the relative benefit. In patients with acute renal failure, it does not appear to be necessary to have either of these procedures followed by open-heart surgery. The authors make several points regarding the care of patients post-op. They recommend that it should be performed regardless of the severity of kidney dysfunction or history. They state that it should be done if the kidney function test results were normal; therefore, they advocate for a transurethral catheter rather than a transurethral vein catheter when performing this procedure compared to open-heart surgery. Unfortunately, these recommendations do not go as far as what many may be expecting. Although they do not recommend doing the endoscopy and nephrectomy simultaneously, they do recommend the use of a sterile nephrectomy, if possible, if the kidney function is lower than is being maintained with the above procedures and only if the patient has a risk that will be minimal. The authors recommend that these patients should be considered for a transurethral catheter and that a transurethral vein catheter with blood transfusion (if needed) should be considered. They also mention that"
Question: Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Cardiovascular risk in a rural adult West African population: is resting heart rate also relevant?

Introduction

A common refrain in scientific literature is a relation involving resting heart rate (RHR). The assumption is that as RHR decreases and heart rate rises in the resting phase, the risk of a cardiovascular event grows. This is an intuitive argument, but the evidence is somewhat lacking. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to investigate this. This has the potential to be of use when doing risk assessments for both patients and clinicians. The review was limited to a single population of women living in rural West Africa. A total study population of almost 600 people was investigated and RHR was not assessed [1].

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between RHR and cardiovascular events in rural West African women. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and causes of cardiovascular events in rural South African women and to investigate the impact of RHR in a cross-section of the women's lives. This also helps to explain why RHR has such a small role in African health care systems, in terms of health care providers' awareness and provision of risk assessment.

Method

The methods used for this study included a meta-analysis of cohort studies [2] for studies which compared RHR levels in rural and urban and in a systematic review and meta-analysis for studies looking in detail at RHR. Additionally we conducted randomised controlled comparison of RHR and other risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

Findings

A total of 23 studies were included in our review, including 14 in rural West Africa, 4 in a community in rural South Africa [3] and 3 in rural Australia [4]. From these studies, 11 in rural West Africa, 8 in villages in one rural South Africa, 8 in community in rural Australia, 2 in community in South Africa (as part of the study) and 1 in community in Australia were identified. All studies found that RHR does not predict cardiovascular events. However, many of these studies failed to report the time of blood draw or have reported RHR with more than one study. The number of reported events varied from 3 (in South Africa) to 26 (in Australia), but the mean (SD) was 6.9 (7.1) weeks. For the same group, the number of non-fatal cardiovascular events was also low (3), including falls, transient ischaemic events, acute ischaemic heart attacks and sudden cardiac death.

Summary of findings

We found no evidence of any relationship between RHR and cardiovascular events in rural South African women. However, although RHR did not predict risk of an adverse cardiovascular event in the sub-population studied, it did suggest a trend towards risk reduction [10]. On the contrary, RHR had a similar effect in a cross section of rural Africans' lives, with very few or no cardiovascular events occurring in the sub-population studied. This does not rule out that RHR might have a role to play.

One explanation is that RHR in rural settings differs from that in urban settings, where there are more health care providers and better systems for reporting RHR. This difference may explain the apparent lack of effect, as it was observed that the majority of studies in rural areas did not report RHR, while in urban settings it was observed that 70% of studies reported RHR. It is also possible that in rural settings RHR might be different from what is observed in a hospital setting as the hospital does not collect RHR data. The number of studies investigating the effect of RHR in rural Africa is extremely small.

Another possibility for RHR's lack of role is that there were insufficient samples in rural settings. These studies usually used a cross section of two or three or four rural populations, to allow for the possibility that RHR differs between those locations. To avoid the type of bias that might arise from different samples that report RHR as a dependent variable from a common time point, these studies used the time point for RHR measurement as the 'pooling time' whereas we used the time of blood draw.

In conclusion, RHR is not associated with cardiovascular events but only with non-fatal events. This is a mixed message but may explain why RHR has a small role in African health care systems."
Question: Israeli hospital preparedness for terrorism-related multiple casualty incidents: can the surge capacity and injury severity distribution be better predicted? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How realistic is the military scenario scenario regarding the use of medical evacuations from Israel, or other countries, for terrorist or extremist attacks on Israeli targets? The Israeli Ministry of Defense (MoD) recently discussed the following challenges that the IDF will have to face in future terrorist attacks on Israeli targets, including attacks in the next days: • When a terrorist has been caught earlier, he is likely to be already carrying bomb-ridden hands and an additional device; • With an existing population of more than 20 million people living in the heart of the Middle East, and with thousands more seeking to escape from Gaza, Lebanon and Syria to escape from war, the IDF's ability to respond to many of the threat scenarios that the IDF plans to face if necessary is less than what it was in the 1990's and 2000's when the IDF fought large-scale wars with no plans for medical evacuations, and where the ability to quickly transport injured casualties to medical evacuation facilities was not as important as in the 1980's and 1990's when large-scale wars were fought with great concern for civilians' safety. In the ""Highyakh"", the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) were widely thought to have been unprepared for Palestinian resistance during the Yom Kippur War in 2000, and the IDF's response after the 2006 Gaza War was not thought to have been as effective as the IDF had hoped. In this context, the IDF will face a host of challenges if the IDF and the IDF Health Authorities (IDH), with the support of other organizations such as the IHAI, decide to move the medical evacuations to a priority setting within the next few days. • The number of wounded combatants and combatants who will need the help of medical evacuation is not being known. • The IDF has a difficult set of requirements and requirements to fulfill; namely, the IDF will be able to evacuate wounded combatants as well as those who will need long-term assistance. • The number of fighters currently being held at Israel's military bases has not been made public to date. This makes the IDF's ability to evacuate the wounded to medical evacuation facilities more difficult, and may delay evacuation. • The IDF's ability to respond rapidly to a potential terrorist attack on Israeli civilians may also have been delayed by the number of potential hostages, and the potential of the hostage situation for Israeli hostages being a target for terrorists. In these terms, the IDF's response time to a possible threat to Israeli civilians will be more costly, or longer than in the past, when the IDF responded rapidly to a specific attack, with limited casualties, against an IDF force in need of medical evacuation. • IDF medical evacuation in general is not able to respond quickly to attacks in the future; and the IDF's preparedness plans may not prevent a future terrorist attack against Israeli civilians, or may not provide medical evacuation facilities in the near future. • The Israeli Defense Ministry should continue to develop and promote a health system that can rapidly and efficiently respond to the medical needs of the IDF troops on the battlefield. • The Israeli Health Ministry and its allies should continue to raise awareness and create awareness regarding the need to evacuate wounded soldiers from the field, and should create procedures to facilitate the evacuation of injured Soldiers and their families from the field. • The IDF's medical evacuation infrastructure cannot immediately respond to unforeseen emergencies of any kind, such as natural disasters, or incidents that might threaten the hospital's own medical and scientific centers, and must be able to rapidly and efficiently respond. The IDF Chief of Staff's Health Committee and his staff have put in place a comprehensive working plan (Health Working Plan), outlining a set of specific demands for an IDF Health Authority within four to six weeks. The IDF Health Authority will be responsible for the delivery of medical assistance to the military forces, and for the medical transportation of those injured in the IDF operations for which the IDF has a need for medical evacuation capacity. For medical evacuation in the near future, to ensure quick response and to maximize the IDF's ability to respond, the IDF will continue to expand its medical evacuation infrastructure by consolidating ambulances, providing space for ambulances to access the field as a whole, and constructing additional medical evacuation facilities (more than 700 of which are already active). The new ambulances will be equipped with the proper equipment necessary for the evacuation of wounded individuals. The existing ambulances will continue to be used for the emergency and limited evacuation of wounded individuals, and will continue as an integral part of the health care system. When evacuating the injured from the field during an operation that is a military operation, the IDF will first perform a comprehensive plan to evacuate wounded soldiers and their families to other field hospitals, to avoid potential civilian casualties. After conducting medical evacuation, the IDF will maintain and document the status of those who can be evacuated to an area with adequate medical evacuation capacity. During that time, the hospital will also be able to provide transport services"
Question: Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Acute respiratory distress syndrome in children with malignancy--can we predict outcome?

A: This article summarizes the evidence for the relationship between a low oxygen-to-oxygen ratio and lung cancer, but it does not address the question of whether or not all children with asthma are at risk.

B: The effect of oxygen on lung tumor growth in children is controversial. The relationship between oxygen in the blood and lung cancer development has been known since the first large-scale, controlled trial of the effect of increasing hemoglobin levels in babies. This clinical trial found no effect of increasing hemoglobin levels in a group of children with pulmonary hypertension, although many of the other potential confounding factors were different.

C: Early childhood asthma exacerbates the risk of a later growth disability and disease (increased need for supplemental oxygen) among the long-term residents of child-care centers. (The effect of a short-term decrease in oxygen in the blood is not demonstrated.)

D: There is a link with long-term use of corticosteroids. It was shown that children that were given the steroids as young as 2 to 3 years of age (and who then had to take them for many years) had increased risk for developing bronchial asthma. More recently, some studies have found that children who previously had a family history of asthma experienced a higher incidence of short-term exacerbations of asthma.

E: While there is evidence for a causal link between short-term exposure of the airways to environmental factors and short-term adverse outcomes, there is a lack of evidence for a causal link with long-term exposure.

The following section of the article discusses long-term inhaler use following the diagnosis of asthma in children with an oxygen-to-oxygen ratio lower than 25, or the association between this and the development of adult lung cancers. In addition, the following section discusses how to interpret the findings.

Risks of short-term and long-term exposures

Risk of short-term and long-term exposures

Short-term exposure: Inhaler use can cause respiratory distress, and a study by Mazzotti, et al., suggested that one to three inhaled particles from a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids can reach the central nervous system and induce a temporary change in the nervous system which may lead gradually to a condition known as central sensitization.

Long-term exposure: One to four times the typical dose of prednisone (or prednisolone if not used in combination with another agent) may induce lung cancer in children. If inhaled at a large amount, one to two, 3- to 5-cm long particles may reach the central nervous system and induce a temporary change in the nervous system that may lead gradually to a condition known as central sensitization.

Virtually all of the cases of childhood asthma are in school-age children. Most people who have childhood asthma are not receiving treatment, and therefore, there is no evidence that high-dose corticosteroids are needed to prevent disease. However, in a controlled trial in children with asthma, a single dose of inhaled corticosteroids was as good at reducing symptoms as a high dose in adults.[2]

Risk of short-term exposure

Fluid inhaled during the cough is one type of short-term inhaler exposure. High school students used 12 times to 17 times the recommended daily dose of cyclodextrins during the last year.

There is some evidence that long-term exposure is dangerous. The following case illustrates short-term inhaler exposure.

In September, 1987, the owner of a small-town pizza bakery became ill after eating at a large downtown pizzeria. A few hours later, his father was admitted after suffering from acute respiratory distress. He was eventually diagnosed with laryngitis, and he died four months later after being found to have leukemia.

Since then, an autopsy revealed a bronchial tumor in the lung. Within the following week, her condition worsened. He died from a pulmonary embolism. Later tests revealed that the tumor and his father's DNA were identical.

This is not the only reported case of lung cancer among an employee at a New York City pizzeria. On August 6, 1987, Michael Tost, a sales associate, became ill after eating at a pizzeria near his home. It was the seventh day of his job at the time; his work began on July 13. His work area had never contained a child who worked late to avoid the cold, and he only made a few sales for dinner for the next two days.

After his death a week later, the NYPD was investigating. It was determined that Tost's workplace had been used as a"

Question: Most cancer patients would benefit from a ""predictive biomarker"" for future prostate cancer recurrence. Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question: Most cancer patients would benefit from a ""predictive biomarker"" for future prostate cancer recurrence.

Answers: Yes

Question: What does ""BRCA1-2"" mean? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the meaning of ""BRCA1-2""

Answers: BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA3, BRCA5, BRCA6, BRCA8, BRCA11, BRCA12, BRCA12/19

Question: Why does the BRCA test work so well in identifying women at higher risk of recurrence compared with men at lower risk of recurrence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the meaning of ""BRCA test works so well in identifying women at higher risk of recurrence compared with men at lower risk of recurrence.""

Answers: The test predicts up to 95% of a woman's overall prognosis for recurrence, based on her BRCA9 gene. Women with a lower BRCA9 positive status are less likely to recur and may go on to have a better overall prognosis.

Question: How do you decide which patients to test for BRCA1 and BRCA2? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains the rationale behind choosing which patients to test for BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Answers: Because all cancer screenings are only able to identify one cancer and that is BRCA1-2, the current BRCA test has a high false-discovery rate (FDR). It has also been shown that men with a higher BRCA1-2 gene status were less likely to have positive results than men with a lower BRCA1-2 gene level. Therefore, there is a great public health priority to reduce the presence of BRCA-associated mutations in all people, regardless of whether that person has BRCA1 or BRCA2.

Question: How do you define ""overdiagnosed""? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that explains how to define ""overdiagnosed.""

Answers: If a study has 10+ positive BRCA1-2 tests in a particular group of people, they will all define as ""overdiagnosed"" if they have a positive BRCA1-2 test in at least two of the ten individuals, even if the individuals are unlikely to have any recurrence due to the BRCA1-2 test results. Since the 10+ positive BRCA1-2 tests have already been overclassified into overdiagnosed and underdiagnosed in some cases, it creates a substantial false-positive effect by defining the overdiagnosed as having recurrence due to the overdiagnosis.

Question: How many women and men will be overdiagnosed in the next decade or so? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers how many women and men will be overdiagnosed in the next decade or so.

Answers: About 1 in 3000 for men and women and about 1 in 13 men and women on average.

Question: Why in the world do we spend so much time and attention talking about breast cancer recurrence, then not enough time talking about hormone therapy treatment and other forms of cancer treatment? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the question ""Why in the world do we spend so much time and attention talking about breast cancer recurrence, then not enough time talking about hormone therapy treatment and other forms of cancer treatment?""

Answers: Too numerous to list comprehensively, such topics have been studied extensively on all the various levels, in addition to the traditional clinical studies that we are currently reviewing in PubMed, and are all of sufficient relevance that researchers, clinicians and patients alike are still discussing them.

Question: Why does it take time for our health services to diagnose BRCA mutations in women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question ""Why does it take time for our health services to diagnose BRCA mutations in women?""

Answers: We know that BRCA mutations in women are diagnosed much sooner and that the most common BRCA mutations in our population are BRCA2 and BRCA6 (the same BRCA variants that show the strongest relationship).

Question: Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are reports of mechanical dysfunction in chronic oro-facial pain related to somatisation?

A: Mechanical pain syndromes that are related to somatisation are reported in varying degrees, with pain being associated with a variety of mechanical phenomena. One might argue that many reports of such syndromes are of somatisation. The somatisation hypothesis is a hypothesis that in a number of cases the somatization might be the contributing factor for pain, other biomechanical phenomena, even injury to the face, and that this association could explain why some types of chronic pain syndromes are reported without the somatisation component. An alternative view is that some reports of somatisation occur in the context of various different chronic pain syndromes, or in a case-specific case/treatments. In these cases the somatisation should exist in a variety of mechanical states for which there are no other factors to explain the pain.

There may be a difference in somatisation between somatic, and somatic-like mechanical pain syndromes with an associated somatisation component and somatic-like, non-somatic, mechanically and mechanically-related pain syndromes without somatisation. However, this difference has been noted to occur, at least in animals. In humans, we have suggested that some studies might be misclassified as not having the somatisation component because somatisation is seen to be the result of the underlying disease process of the underlying syndrome, rather than being the mechanistic or somatic pain state. It is unclear whether this is the case or not. These issues should be addressed carefully in patients with a diagnosis known to be a mechanotransduction disorder as well as in patients with the somatisation component.

One study looked at patients with migraine and reported some somatisation and pain using an MRI technique. The authors of this study concluded that the MRI findings were in good agreement with histological features of the somatosensory tissue of patients with migraine sufferers, including the presence of an abnormal signal near the coelomic (or primary) layer (Fig 1A,E).

The authors did not examine the relationship to the biomechanical system since it may be difficult to evaluate in normal, normally awake subjects. If somatisation is the underlying cause of pain, then there should be a clear mechano-mechanistic effect of the somatisation component. This effect could be that of the somatic component, but it could also be that of other biomechanical mechanisms.

A second study, which was also carried out by the same company and reported in the same issue (1A) did not provide any evidence that patients with migraine with aura had an abnormal signal near the coelomic (or primary) layer and this could be part of the somatisation hypothesis. There is good agreement between MRI and histological findings (Fig 3, G; E.2, G.2 and J.2; see reference 1) for all samples. One study reported that the histology pattern of patients with migraine with aura was consistent with abnormalities of the coelomic layer in the somato-sensory cortex (1B).

B: Skeletal muscle biopsies of patients with chronic facial pain have been reported [and may be the subject of further investigation]. A sample of 22 patients was recruited. Some reports of mechanical dysfunction in pain associated with chronic facial pain included mechanical sensations in the facial lamina propria and in the superior part of the anterior temporal bone, as well as in the posterior part of the temporal bone (see references 1 and 4 for a detailed review of these reports). Although all the patients in this study had migraine on presentation, there was no evidence for any abnormality of the cortical biopsy or of muscle microcirculation within the facial bone area. There was also some evidence for abnormalities of muscle biopsy location [which probably reflects a more localized damage to a single region of the skin or bone] but not in any of the muscle tissue, as the number of reported histological findings is much too low. Some reports [1B,E,3, 4] have identified the somatisation component as an etiological component in patients with chronic facial pain.

A: The most common somatisation is in the intermandibular joint and may begin with a pain sensation during the stretching of the muscle. The muscle is then felt as an irregular pressure on the mandibular lumbar region and sometimes there is pain on movement in this area. The pressure over this region in facial pain might be thought of as an intrusion of pain over the mandibular lumbar region. The somatisation and other mechanical symptoms can be seen in almost any study and there are a variety of such symptoms that may be seen in patients"
Question: Amblyopia: is visual loss permanent? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

A. What are the common causes of amblyopia and how most people respond to them?

B. How does an amblyopic person interpret his or her amblyopic status?

C. Have other causes of amblyopia been identified? What other explanations have been found?


Answer


(A. B.)

A. Amblyopia is defined as near-sightedness, where the visual fields overlap in an acute way. People who have amblyopia do not notice this at all. Usually they are aware of nearsightedness, but they think other things that the other senses are fine.


(B)

You need an explanation about how this works.

You can use a metaphor that people will relate to. Example

""A patient with amblyopia sees better colors when viewed at one end or the other...""""This patient may not look at the same colors at two perspectives because they have very different visual fields from the central eye. In such cases a patient with amblyopia thinks about the color more because the other senses are not engaged,"".

(A C)

What is an amblyopic person?

""A person with amblyopia has normal vision at distance but not in close-up vision. This person often feels ambivalent to the world around them. This person may have very strong or vivid eye movements during close-up sight...""

(B)A person who does not recognize and/or see in the world around him or her is called an amblyopic.

""A person with an amblyopic field of vision may have a very weak field of vision in close-up vision.""


(C)

What's the answer?

(A. B.)

A. Amblyopia occurs in nearly all people. I can't tell you what it is like in other cases; there is a lot of variation here, but it is not uncommon. A person who sees better colors from one end of the visual field than the other, is a person with amblyopia; it's not uncommon to ""see in the world"". This doesn't mean we see better at a given distance if we are standing still. The eye-brain system is very good at discriminating between near and far and is always trying to maximize the sense of what goes on in the eye's visual field of view. A person who thinks about a given thing just happens to see the thing in his/her field of vision. That may be confusing. But the truth is, people often get confused if they are unaware of the differences in the fields of vision around them. If you do not respond, that's not what you are saying! If you are amblyopic, that means you have normal vision. Amblyopes always have poor vision. They don't have visual acuity, which is about 3-6/8 - inches (8-24mm) in distance, but they have normal field of view.

Here are some articles: What is an amblyopic.

What is normal visual acuity.

Why do amblyopes get confused?

Answer

(A. B.)

A. ""Normal visual acuity"" refers to the minimum distances per inch (e.g., 3/32"") that the visual field can cover. It doesn't imply that each of your cones, rods, or photoreceptors fills that space perfectly. When you look at something at 10cm, the distance it can cover in one eye for about 20 seconds is about 2.5 metres (8-24 feet) and varies with how good the lenses are working for you and your genetics; you have to be careful about picking up on the more distant things first. If you can't see that fine detail better with two glasses then you might consider optometrist intervention.

""Normal visual acuity"" means a person with average visual acuity at near distance, for any given distance. Normal visual acuity at a distance of 10cm is 10/80. Some people have normal visual acuity at distances of about 20m (61 feet) but only about 10m (1.6 feet) is usable. This is usually because of vision disorders like hyperopia and/or astigmatism. For those people, there is a constant range of visual fields that they need to use to have a normal visual experience.

Here are some articles: Why do retinitis pigmentosa patients have normal vision below 20m and vision in some other parts of their visual field?

Why do patients with visual disturbances or vision disorders have poor visual acuity?


(G.)

""Near vision"" means seeing near objects, in the three-dimensional space that surrounds them. For example, if they were standing"
Question: Implementation of epidural analgesia for labor: is the standard of effective analgesia reachable in all women? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Implementing epidural analgesia for labor: may the standard of effective analgesia for labor be reached?

The goal of this study was to compare the cost of epidural analgesia in the first two weeks of labor, with standard of effectiveness measures (as measured by the rate of analgesic use or the duration of use). We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for randomised controlled trials that compared the use of epidural analgesia in the first two weeks of labor, or the standard of effectiveness measures, with other analgesic use as judged by the rate of analgesic use, including general analgesia or other general pain control measures. We contacted authors of trials that met these criteria, who were asked how many women in their studies used epidural analgesia as compared with a control (placebo), on a 0 to 2 scale. If a trial had more than 10 women in the study, the rate of control was used. If a trial did not have enough women for a 0 to 2 scale, a 0 to 3 scale was used.

This is the first Cochrane review of epidural analgesia for labor published after 9 years of activity, so we were surprised to find that many trials were still working through many years of debate about what measures should be used, and how well those measures met our goals. It was also surprising even more that most trials examined epidural analgesia as a control for pain during the second stage of labor. The consensus was that the second stage of labor begins when the uterine cavity is fully dilated and the cervix fully penetrated. In order to maximise analgesia, a very large number of women in both clinical and theoretical studies used epidural morphine for induction, followed by epidural acetaminophen on day 3. While it seemed that epidural morphine and acetaminophen in combination would be the key to optimal analgesia, only 17 trials involving 1.8 million patients in total measured pain during the second stage and did not show substantial improvement. In a later Cochrane Review, the authors concluded that 'with the exception of 2 studies, no other trials showed that either control or analgesia during the second stage of labor was more frequently performed than control.' (23) Most of the trials were conducted in European countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, where some women, especially women in low income and/or minority groups, have been found to be unable to access epidural analgesia. With the onset of Medicare spending on healthcare for new mothers, it becomes apparent that the quality of trials has fallen. We are aware of a number of trials that are clearly over-utilising available analgesia, but we were able to find only a handful of trials not meeting our definition. Therefore, there have been numerous missed opportunities to improve research.

Our results should be reassuring to those women that have used epidural analgesia, and for who the standard of effectiveness measurement is a difficult one to assess, to be completely satisfied. We do not expect that in most women, the standard of effectiveness is reached at all, but instead that epidural analgesia does provide substantial analgesia at a lower cost than the control of analgesia in combination of general analgesia, general pain control, or any pain control measures. The problem we have with the concept of 'effective analgesia' is that the quality of evidence needed to decide whether or not to use a drug of choice is often very poor. That is why it is so important to use a systematic review and meta-analysis in place of observational studies. The only difference is that observational studies can help with evaluating which measures are effective and which are not. The fact that there are so many trials that provide conflicting information between these measures of effectiveness clearly needs to be taken into account.

Some studies had a higher threshold at which pain thresholds were considered too low for analgesia to be considered 'effective'. While these trials may be valid data, their use did not necessarily mean that the cost-effectiveness of epidural analgesia cannot be assessed. It may be that higher thresholds were acceptable, as long as the threshold could be reached without taking long periods of time. However in the current context, the current method of assessing costs, based on a patient's experience of pain, also has an inherent bias in favour of an analgesic or drugs for pain control such as morphine. An important question that was discussed in a review by MacIntyre et al. (24) was whether any type of analgesia could be classified as effective because of the patient's experience or knowledge of pain. In our study, most women in the control group were able to experience pain during the first few days of their first round because of their history. However in the case of women who initially tried to discontinue analgesia or only started a partial cessation, the rate of analgesic use was higher among"

Question: Is halofantrine ototoxic? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is halofantrine ototoxic?


Answer: The clinical situation concerning the safety of a medication given to an epileptic patient is not fully known. It should be determined whether certain effects occur in patients who receive the drug. There are some reports of the use of this drug at a dose which is very low (less than 1 mg). The only difference for this drug from the traditional anticonvulsant drugs is that it affects the peripheral nervous system.


Halofantrine has been studied in a wide range of different animal and human animal models. From the animal model studies, it has been suggested that certain brain or central nervous system effects of the drug could be elicited. However, these animal studies did not explore all the possible consequences of the drug in relation to the epileptic brain, and these effects need further exploration for further clinical trials.


In general, the clinical effect of halofantrine is most likely short lived (1-5 days) which lasts until the seizure ceases. Because the halofantrine is injected into the nerve, any changes (and consequently irreversible effects) in the nervous system are less likely to be discovered than in the case of other medications. No reports of the possible long-term effects of the drug have been published. However, there are many cases of long-term epileptic activity, which could occur if the patient continues to take the drug and fails to go into a state of unconsciousness. Such cases represent a serious problem in the long term, especially in young children who are especially sensitive to the effects of halofantrine. This in turn raises concerns about possible long-term toxic reactions. The fact that there are no long-term adverse events associated with halofantrine suggests that the drug should not be prescribed to patients.


It has to be reminded that the drug is not used for epileptic activity and that it is not suitable as a treatment for seizures in children. More information about the use of this drug in different medical settings is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency."

Frozen Bones

Question: Is a frozen bone an acceptable material for the study of bones, or can it not be frozen? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Questions: Are samples of frozen marrow and bone obtained from healthy individuals really acceptable for the study of bones? Can the frozen marrow and bone be analyzed for their presence of antibodies or for their ability to signal a bone marrow disease diagnosis?

Answer: This type of study is only feasible if you include a healthy non-pregnant female subject; in all other cases, you should consider an additional source and obtain the subject to evaluate for the presence of bone marrow disease. In any case, a freeze-dried specimen should be treated with 1ml of the following anti-cancer drug (i.e., 1ml of Laminarin or Ampicillin) twice daily for 4 to 10 days (or until bone looks like a complete stump), following which a marrow culture should be obtained. The bone is subjected to a heat machine to destroy any pathogens, and after 3 weeks, the specimens of the marrow and bone were analyzed. The culture results should be presented at a meeting of orthopedic surgeons.

Question: Prognosis of well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma--is well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:,"

Is well differentiated small hepatocellular carcinoma clinically early or clinically advanced?

Answer:

The prognosis of small hepatocellular carcinoma is poor, although the average survival is 10-17 years in the United States.

The following table summarizes the prognosis:

Stage 1

Stage 2

Stage III or stage IV

Stage IV

Stage V

Stage VI

In patients treated successfully for small hepatocellular carcinoma (L5-6), the following benefits are anticipated (Note: There is no specific treatment of non-advanced liver cancers). These benefits include:

the chance of the cancer developing into liver cancer

a significantly lower need for surgical interventions (such as liver transplantation)

the chance that the cancer may be eliminated.

To be considered for early diagnosis, patients must have, at the minimum, a 10-mm (1/16"") or more tumor in the liver, a non-small cell carcinoma, and have been tested for metastatic disease (see below).

The following table summarizes the benefits of early detection, including early surgical procedures, for L5-6. The benefit for a 15-mm (1/16"") or more tumor in the liver is a 15-year survival rate of 75%.

Benefits of early detection, including:

Stage III

Stage IV

Stage V

Stage VI

The mortality rate for low-grade liver cancer is approximately 3%.

Survivors who undergo surgery for liver cancer are given an increased chance of survival if a significant portion of the tumor is removed (see below).

Surgical therapies for small hepatocellular carcinoma commonly use the following types of operations:

capping (e.g., liver flotation)

amploprostomy (e.g., abdominal aortoplasty)

open-heart surgery to increase the size of the vessel

In patients treated successfully for advanced small hepatocellular carcinoma (L6-7), there are no specific treatment options. As a result, a significant number of patients will have their liver resected and continue with chemotherapy and physical therapy.

There is no specific treatment of non-advanced liver cancers. Some early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma is accomplished with specialized imaging techniques and anesthetics. A significant number of non-advanced liver cancers develop into non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLC) without the traditional surgery. To date, these non-small cell cancers are the most resistant to aggressive therapy.

Non-aggressive treatment options for advanced liver cancers include surgery as well as surgery and radiation therapy.

The major surgical therapies for non-advanced liver cancer include:

Liver flotation

amploprostomy

open-heart surgery (e.g., aortoplasty)

prostheses (e.g., aortic stent and aortic sleeve)

surgery with an open air vein (e.g., transvalvular or open-heart surgery)

reposition

intervention (e.g., parenteral mesenteric valve)

In cancer patients with large tumors, surgery is often recommended. The most common surgical procedure done for large liver tumors is resecting of the liver (aortoplasty), and the procedure provides the greatest potential benefit for small or advanced liver cancers.

For patients who do not wish to undergo resecting, a variety of other options are available. For example, aortic stents can be used as a temporary solution for non-advanced liver cancers. Surgery-only techniques (e.g., liver resection, partial-appendix resection [PAOS], open-heart surgery) are also used with less than optimal success rates.

There is a significant amount of controversy regarding the optimal type of surgery for non-advanced liver cancer. Some studies have shown that the use of either open-heart surgery or aseptic procedures (e.g., pneumoperitoneum; aortoplasty) may result in more benefit with the potential for a much higher complication rate.

Aseptic techniques have been shown to significantly improve the outcome of non-advanced liver cancers when compared with surgical resection. One study conducted among 75 patients with advanced (L6-7) liver cancer found that those with use of two anastomosing and two bifascial techniques had a 50% reduced complication rate compared with non-specialists. In contrast, a multicentre study of 150 patients with advanced liver cancer observed that those who received pneumoperitone"
Question: Do follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influence patient adherence? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Are follow-up recommendations for abnormal Papanicolaou smears influenced by the quality or completeness of the Papanicolaou smear? Review the evidence: a literature review (or other evidence-based review) (8) Review the literature to establish that the Papanicolaou smear remains a key clinical indication for testing for an infectious disease. (9) Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to screen all infected persons for HIV, pneumococcus, and hepatitis for hepatitis C RNA (HCV RNA) by a single test. There are no randomized controlled trials to support any method of HCV testing which includes RNA testing. Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to select HIV positive persons based on hepatitis C RNA tests alone as the sole tool for testing HIV-infected persons, with emphasis on the need for a double-blind randomized controlled trial to ensure the specificity and confidence of the HCV positive diagnosis. Review the literature for the evidence-based recommendation to recommend that all persons with a positive HCV positive test for HIV should receive a presumptive treatment plan and blood pressure medication. There are no data demonstrating any benefit from this routine method of determining HIV-positive persons for routine medical or dental treatment. There are no comparative data supporting the use of HCV-positive urine samples for determination of HIV prevalence among persons with other infectious diseases. Review the literature to establish whether an intervention or alternative can be better suited to meet the identified challenge to Papanicolaou smears in certain clinical situations. Review the evidence to determine whether testing for Hepatitis B RNA should be considered for Papanicolaou smears, considering the existing availability of available test kits and the absence of efficacy and specificity of other test technologies. These guidelines are NOT comprehensive and do not address the recommendations for Papanicolaou smear, or the recommended use of HCV-specific kits. (11)

Discussion This article is a thorough evaluation of available evidence on the use of Papanicolaou smears for the diagnosis or screening of HIV infection, and its impact on disease. Based on this evidence, it appears that the primary benefits associated with diagnostic confirmation of infection for the HIV infection can be more accurately estimated using HCV-specific test kits, while there remain limitations on the use of Papanicolaou smears in screening for other infectious diseases or routine medical or dental treatment. This evidence does not support the use of Papanicolaou smears as a diagnosis instrument other than those for HIV infection, as recommended in previous recommendations. The main advantages of testing for HIV infection with HCV-specific DNA were identified in this review. The HCV tests were effective in detecting HIV infection (i.e., testing positive) at a lower cost. The HCV-specific tests were reliable, accurate, and comparable with those used for HIV detection and detection of other infections. Moreover, the HCV types detected in the Papanicolaou smears were not known to be associated with HIV infection (i.e., different HCV RNA types were detected in the Papanicolaou smears than in HIV tests). This suggests that the HCV-specific test kits might be useful for diagnosing other infectious diseases, and a useful diagnostic assay for HIV infection (i.e., HCV RNA). However, the positive findings reported in this review also underscore the limitations of using HCV-specific tests for diagnosis of infectious diseases and as a screening tool for routine medical or dental treatment. Thus, the ability to use HCV-specific blood tests to determine whether people with HIV infection are asymptomatic and asymptomatic, as was suggested in another literature review of HIV screening and management (11), is unlikely to be supported by current evidence. With respect to the treatment of HIV infection, the current scientific evidence provides limited support for a recommendation to screen all persons with a Papanicolaou smear for HIV and HCV before recommending that anyone be treated to prevent subsequent development of infectious disease. A significant body of evidence, however, suggests that when HIV treatment is indicated, the HCV-specific test results must be considered during management of HIV infections, regardless of other therapeutic options. The available evidence also indicates that current recommendations for treating HIV infection are effective, and are reasonable at each stage along the HIV continuum between undetectable viral load and acute HIV infection. Thus, current recommendations for the initial management of positive or positive for HIV samples, which are based on a single test with a sensitivity > 97% and a specificity of > 98%, still align with recommendations for early treatment of cases of symptomatic HIV (i.e., HIV < 2000) and in managing patients of HIV-associated chronic HIV disease. The recommended management based on the sensitivity and specificity of the Papanicolaou test are as follows. For the initial management of HIV infection (i.e"
Question: Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Biomolecular identification of allergenic pollen: a new perspective for aerobiological monitoring?

Abstract: The pollen of maize (Zea mays L.) is a well-recognized source of allergenic pollen for the domestic market. However, recent efforts to identify allergenic phenotypes are hampered by difficulties in pollen identification in other cereal crops. An understanding of the processes by which pollen proteins are derived is essential to a successful analysis of allergenic pollens. Thus, we report on the identification of an Allergy-Strain-Type (AST) of corn pollen by the use of genomic and biochemical assays in corn, and a recent attempt by plant breeders to characterize the genetics underlying allergenic traits. We show that the AST of maize pollen arises from a different genetic source from other crop allergens, and reveals some of the key regulatory processes that are required to create allergenic traits. We provide novel genetic models for AST in maize that are useful to provide an understanding of pollen production and to stimulate new research.

Abstract

Pollen from maize presents a very important source of allergens to farm machinery of all grain and grain byproducts, since it contains three-fourths to one-third of all of the pollen, when tested by the pollen allergy questionnaire. The identification of allergenic pollen by genotypic comparison with a variety of crop allergens and the determination of the alleles responsible for these reactions should significantly simplify the detection of allergenic pollen in commercial crops. However, it is well known that various methods are needed in order to identify allergenic pollen, including DNA-based, biochemical, immunological and electrophoretic assays. A key step for allergenic pollen is the formation of functional, genetic alleles as alleles are produced when pollen is processed and transported. The genetic analyses reported so far cannot determine the alleles and the genetic changes in the pollen can only be detected by a specific analytical technique. Therefore, a new approach was needed in order to identify allergenic pollen in maize, and here we report on an allerogen genotypic analysis of maize pollen using a genome-wide approach, by using the allergen detection methodology provided by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Here we report the identification of an Allergy-Strain-Type as the most sensitive and accurate method for allergen detection in maize. Our results demonstrate that the allergenic alleles in pollen are highly conserved, are closely related to the characteristics of the pollen, and that the AST of maize pollen is genetically different from all other pollen types. These results provide a platform for analyzing allergenic pollen in maize, and allow genotypic analysis of the pollen to be performed in a practical way. To this end, we are planning a comprehensive study to elucidate the molecular basis for these differences by the use of genome-wide approaches.

Introduction

Pollen is one of the most important sources of allergens to pollen-processing machinery of grain and byproducts, since it contains three to one-fourth of all the pollen, when tested by the pollen allergy questionnaire [1]. While both plant and animal allergens may present themselves as proteins, only plant allergens are regarded as allergenic. The pollen can also contain proteins from other crops, but they are considered to cause allergic respiratory symptoms [2–4]. The only plant-based allergen with sufficient evidence of its existence is corn ("
Question: Does diabetes mellitus influence the efficacy of FDG-PET in the diagnosis of cervical cancer? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," How do people who are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the first year of life show a negative association with FDG-PET?

Background

An emerging literature suggests that an initial association of cervical cancer (CIN 2+) with a high-fat diet [1,2] is associated with adverse cervical mucosa and dysplasia. This negative association is thought to be the result of increased mucosal and interstitial tissue destruction by the cancer-producing microenvironment of the diseased cervix.

Recent studies have confirmed negative associations of CIN2+ with both hyperalgesia and cancer in a large cohort of female patients [3–7]. The study by Chard et al. [3] followed 1,054 newly diagnosed patients within the first 2 years of life. The authors reported an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.01 to 2.14) for an increased likelihood of undergoing pap smear, although the magnitude of the associated risk appeared to be underestimated in some subgroups due to the relatively small sample size of their study.

Although the association between hyperalgesia and invasive cervical cancer is well established, the mechanisms regulating the pathogenesis of this malignancy are not well known. Several studies have been conducted evaluating the possible involvement of cytokines in the disease process [8–11]. In addition to the established relationship between hyperalgesia and CIN 2+ (for example, elevated serum interleukin-1 receptor antagonist concentration is associated with increased risk of CIN 2+) [12], hyperalgesia is also associated with increased intraepithelial inflammation and cellular oxidative stress. In a separate randomized trial [13], it was noted that the occurrence of CIN2+ and the development of cancer were also associated with serum levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that hyperalgesia-associated tumors are composed not only of tumor-specific and cytokine-associated cells but also of cells with other cytokine receptors.

Recently, the hypothesis of a ""tumor-specific"" inflammatory mediator(s) within the carcinoma microenvironment has been proposed. It is hypothesized that these cytokines may modulate the behavior of cancer cells to facilitate tumor progression through signaling pathways [14,15]. It would therefore be important to evaluate the effects of hyperalgesia-associated colorectal neoplasia on the development of these tumor-specific tumor-specific cytokines within the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the purpose of the present Study, which was designed to evaluate the associations of CIN2+, anti-CTLA4 colorectal tumor virus (CTLA4) and hyperalgesia on CXCR4 tumor cell adhesion and growth in human epithelial and mesenchymal cells, was to examine whether hyperalgesia-associated CIN2+ was associated with adhesion and growth inhibition in the breast carcinoma (BCM) and cervical adenocarcinoma (CIN 2+ of women from 3–35 years of age).

Methods

Participants and Sample

Three hundred ten healthy white women aged 21–55 y were enrolled. Of these women, 90 percent were Caucasian [16]. The majority (n = 75) were from the Greater Kansas City Area (GKCA). The study was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board and was conducted under the Institutional Review Board of the University of Missouri, Columbia. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants using the approved data use form.

Exclusion criteria and screening procedures are described in detail herein.

Cervical Cancer Screening

BCM or CIN2+ screening was performed in the first year of life. The study protocol included inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria as follows:

All participants were white; female; in the first 2 years of life; and with a family history of invasive cervical cancer.

Cavity biopsies were conducted for women with no documented evidence of carcinoma (ie, no symptoms of carcinoma or significant changes in cervical cytology).

Cervical lesions were defined as:

M1 (deep carcinoma of the cervical region) (5–7 lesion size).

M2 (6–9 lesion size).

M3 (10–14 lesion size).

M4 (15–19 lesion size).

M5 (20–32 lesion size).

M6 (33+ lesions size).

M7 (33+ lesions size).

CXCR4 Cancer

CXCR4 cancer was assessed by the use of colon, rectal, and prostate cytology screening. The screening examinations included two types of DNA probes (CT"

Question: Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Can a practicing surgeon detect early lymphedema reliably? Share your answer

Can a surgeon detect early lymphedema? Lymphedema refers to swelling in a limb, sometimes at the site of a vein or an artery, which can affect or rupture. Surgery—or the healing of a wound—often corrects the inflammation by reducing the volume of the swelling, or lymphedema.

Early lymphedema can show up on x-ray or ultrasound and can be treated. By screening for early lymphedema, a surgeon might be able to detect it early, before it's too late. Lymphedema can be diagnosed on the basis of the results of x-rays or CT scans; CTs and MRI scans do not generally show abnormal veins, but CT might show a small tumor nearby. CT scans can show a lump or mass around a vein (arterial lymphedema). X-ray images of veins have a different ""look"": They show enlarged veins, called nodules, filled with fluid, and can be difficult to differentiate from a lump in a vein. In contrast, MRI scans show a larger, more normal area on the surface of a vein (luminal lymphedema): It can show a tumor (luminal lymphedema) and other normal tissue. (An MRI scan can detect a lump that turns out larger than the vein or a tumor that grows very little.) In some cases, the surgeon might diagnose this more advanced stage via ultrasound. An advanced detection would give the surgeon an opportunity to treat the lymphedema and provide early healing.

If a surgeon detects early lymphedema, the treatment options for patients with lymphedema are clear and may range from surgery to intensive care. In all cases, you should discuss the options with your medical director. Although many patients are initially diagnosed with early lymphedema, there is some variation in prognostic factors (such as bone density) between patients. Early lymphedema can be treated or reversed if the underlying bone density is improved or the swelling is treated. However, more than 70% of patients with early lymphedema do not have any visible change on MRI or x-ray.

The treatment options for a number of patients with early lymphedema are:

Recurrent or recurrent lymphedema. Recurrent lymphedema occurs when the initial treatment did not produce improvement. This can be due to a variety of factors, including:

Age

Cancer

Curetting steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system

Early infection

Surgery that can cause scarring

Treatment options for an individual patient vary. Some patients respond well to a combination of conventional and alternative therapies. The main differences in treatment between the types and the types of lymphedema are:

Chemotherapy. Treatment options usually include a combination of hormone therapy and surgery to remove scarring, called ""regroupment."" Treatment options include hormonal therapy and/or surgery to remove scarring, called ""regroupment."" Because of the need for surgical procedures, treatment for most cases is recommended for adults. An increasing number of pediatric patients also receive treatment with chemotherapy.

Surgery. Surgery is the most common treatment option for early lymphedema. Some patients can manage lymphedema by surgery in the setting of a local clinic or a community health center, or by managing the swelling with a skin taping method such as lymphedema tape (sclerotherapy). In some situations, though, local lymphedema management is recommended for patients with severe lymphedema.

Treatment options involve surgery. Many patients who have lymphedema respond well to surgery (usually, the patients can live with residual symptoms after surgery). Even when lymphedema is fully present and remitters have been treated and removed from the body, lymphedema is an insidious condition that requires surgical removal if present. For patients with early lymphedema, there may not be any identifiable lesion to remove surgery is a recommended alternative to other options for immediate retreatment.

An example of the treatment in which early lymphedema can be more easily managed is treatment by chemotherapy, which often removes the tumor in the neck/brachial area of the cancer. A number of patients may also respond to treatment with a combination of local and systemic chemotherapy."

Question: Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality? Write an abstract for a scientific paper that answers the Question:," Is motion perception deficit in schizophrenia a consequence of eye-tracking abnormality?

Answer: Yes, I agree that this could be a consequence. A more nuanced explanation is that the person was tracking a moving object, and so it is possible to imagine how their mind would change a few degrees (if they moved so quickly at the onset that they could see at the end the second event that triggered the tracking) - perhaps because they were already tracking the motion. That doesn't explain why they saw the second event. In my opinion, we don't really have much of a clue and are missing a powerful, common mechanism by which motion perception might be compromised. I am also interested in learning more about the mechanism of motion perception in schizophrenia to understand this difference.

Q: Is the hypothesis that schizophrenia produces a deficit in eye movements valid? The theory of ""attraction to the eye"" has been explored and proposed in schizophrenia.

A good example of a theory of attraction to the eye can be found in the work of Burch (1996, 1998) who investigated movement perception. He demonstrated that when persons with schizophrenia display increased attention to the eyes and a decreased ability to move the entire body, these results are not random. These differences are not due to a lack of attention to the moving object but are the result of significant perceptual impairment, which is a consequence of illness.
